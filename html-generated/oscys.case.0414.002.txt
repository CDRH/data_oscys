         <p>To the Honble the Circuit Court of <del>Alexandria</del> the Dist of Columbia for the County of Alexandria</p>

      <div class="body">

         <p>On examining the Case of the petitioner Harriet Lemon it appears that Nelly Lemon the mother of the petitioner was a slave and the property of one Lanty Crowe who resided in the town of Alexandria. That about the year 1800 or 1801 the said Lanty Crowe sold the said Nelly Lemon to John Bayne then of Prince Georges County in the State of Maryland. That after that time Nelly was carried to the City of Washington, and was subsequently &amp; prior to 1812 removed to the State of Maryland in violation of the laws of Maryland, in which state she resided for more than 12 months. That the said Nelly the mother of the petitioner and several of her Children were adjudged to be free <del>upon that</del> &amp; that the petitioner was born subsequent to 1812 by your honbl Court held in the City of Washington at May term 1832 upon these facts as has been stated to me. That the petitioner <del>is about</del> was born about the year 1820 subsequently to the removal of the said Nelly to Maryland.</p>

         <p>On this Statement I think the petitioner entitled to her freedom.</p>
