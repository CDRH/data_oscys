            following three persons of the pannel sworn in the cause (here insert their names)
            were

            stood indifferent between the parties in this cause.

         <p>The said Juror Jas. Reed thereupon voluntarily stated to the
            Court &amp; the Triers that he had not heard the evidence in the cause nor made
            up nor expressed any opinion on the subject &amp; that he should be guided by
            the evidence offered in the cause.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Thereupon the Court asked the said Juror
            James Reed whether he stood indifferent between the said
            parties &amp; whether his prejudices would prevent his so standing indifferent.

            should certainly in such an Event feel himself bound to find a verdict in favor of
            the Petitioner. Whereupon the Court instructed the said 
            Triers that if they
            believed such Confession &amp; Evidence then they should find that the said
            Reed did not stand in different between the said parties
