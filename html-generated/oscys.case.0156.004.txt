         <p>Personally appeared before the Subscriber a Justice of the Peace in &amp; for sd Cty John
            Thornton a mulatto man who stated that he had instituted a suit in the City of Washington
            to recover his freedom from his master Irvin Davis, that he is desirous that said
            suit should be dismissed, &amp; that his determination to dismiss the same is of his own
            free will, &amp; not induced by any compulsion on the part of his master Mr Davis And
            that he desired me to take his acknowledgement to this effect, in order that it might
            be exhibited to his Counsel in Washington, as a request from him &amp; as an authority
            to them to dismiss the said suit Given under my hand &amp; seal this 3 day of June 1835
         </p>

         <p>I certify that the above named John Thornton was examined apart from his master by
            Mr Miller &amp; myself &amp; the character of the act he was about to do was fully explained
            to him &amp; that our examination into the question whether the act was of his own free
            will &amp; not under any undue influence was minute &amp; particular. But the said boy continued
            with pertinacity to insist that the above acknowledgement should be taken &amp; that he
            still wished the suit to be dismissed Mr Davis gave the boy his choice to be taken
            back to Washington, but he declined
