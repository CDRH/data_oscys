         <p>To the Honble the Circuit Court of the District 
            of Columbia— The Petition of John Bradley humbly sheweth 
            that he is entitled to his freedom &amp; is unjustly held in confinement 
            in the jail of this County— Your Petitioner states that he filed his 
            petition returnable to this term against 
            Thomas Shelton 
            <del class="to">to</del> whom he supposed 
            claimed your Petitioner as a Slave, but he has since understood 
            that said Shelton had sold him to a certain
            Pendleton Heronimus, who has caused him to be
            confined in the jail of Washington County where 
            he now is; and he has reason to believe that the said 
            Pendleton Heronimus has endeavoured to sell 
            him to strangers and does 
            design so to sell him to deprive him of the benefit of his 
            Petition aforesaid. Wherefore he prays your honors that a 
            subpona may be issued directed to said Pendleton Heronimus
            returnable forthwith commanding him to appear and answer to your 
            
            <del class="Pendleton Heronimus">Pendleton Heronimus</del> Petitioner 
            in the premisses and to enter into recognizance in the usual form 
            &amp; that your honors will grant him such other relief in the premisses 
            as to your honors may seem just &amp; right &amp;c
