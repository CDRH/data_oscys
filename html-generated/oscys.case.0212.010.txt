         <p>The interrogatories hereto annexed touching the above case, were severally propounded
            to me by David Steiner Esq. a justice of the peace in &amp; for Frederick County &amp; State
            of Maryland, and the following answers are true to the best of my recollection, knowledge
            and belief.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 1st Interrogatory on the part of the defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, that I first became acquainted with the petitioners Thomas Butler and
            Sarah his wife in the year 1803. they were hired by John Dells or Dales to my husband
            Christian Getzendanner for about one year. I do not know Gabriel Duvall the above
            named defendant. I have not known the said petitioners since they left my husband.
            which was in the year 1804.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 2d Interrogatory on the part of the defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, that I first became acquainted with John Dales in the year 1803, when
            he lived with my husband in the capacity of Bar-keeper, for about one year. I did
            not know John Dales when he resided in Montgomery County: John Dales lived about one
            year in the year 1803, with my husband in George Town in the capacity of Bar-keeper.
            The said John Dales during the time he lived with my husband in George Town, during
            the year1803, had and owned the said Thomas Butler and Sarah his wife as his slaves
            and hired them to my husband as his slaves. I understood that John Dales had lived
            in George Town for a considerable time before I am my husband went there to live.
            This I understood when we first went there to live.

         <p>To 3d Interrogatory on the part of the defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, that I do not know. I believe Mr. Dales came to George Town to reside
            before I did. I found him there. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 4th Interrogatory on the part of the defendant. My answer is, that John Dales lived
            in George Town in the year 1803 and for some time before but I cannot recollect how
            long. His occupation was that of Bar-keeper for my husband for one year the year 1803
            and after that my husband sold him his grocery store, which he attended to 
            <del class="her">her</del> his occupation
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 5th Interrogatory on the part of the Defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, that I did not know John Dales, when he was tenant to Mrs. Thompson
            nor when he was tenant to Matthew Kennedy, nor when he lived with Flaut. I knew him
            when he lived with Christian Getzendanner in the year 1803, and I believe he lived
            with William Duvall in the year 1804, after I left George Town. John Dales was not
            engaged in partnership with my husband Christian Getzendanner in a grocery store,
            but had the entire ownership of the said grocery store, my husband having sold the
            store to him.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 6th Interrogatory on the part of the defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, that John Dales owned Thomas Butler and Sarah his wife as slaves during
            all the time that I knew him as before stated. I do not know whether he ever hired
            said slaves in Montgomery County or in George Town. Except to my husband Christian
            Getzendanner as before stated.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To 7th Interrogatory on the part of the Defendant.</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is that I know nothing more than I have already stated.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>To 1st Interrogatory on the part of the petitioners</p>
         
         
         <p>My answer is, I do not know.</p>
