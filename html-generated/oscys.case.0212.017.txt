         <p>And the said Gabriel Duval, in his proper person, comes and says that the circuit
            court of the District of Columbia here ought not, as he humbly conceives, to have
            cognizance of the petition aforesaid, because he says, that ever since the first institution
            of the said court here, by the statute in such case provided &amp; passed by the legislature
            of the State of Maryland, at the November session in 1796 of the general Assembly
            of the said State, and ever since the said session remaining unreeled and in full
            force &amp; operation within the said State, and ever since the 27th day of February 1801,
            adopted &amp; in full force &amp; operation within the county of Washington aforesaid, by

            said State of Maryland, and actually settled &amp; resident in the county of Prince George's

            of the District aforesaid or elsewhere in the said District. And this he is ready
            to verify. Wherefore, since the said petition is brought for recovery of the freedom
            of the said petitioners, so residing in the county of Prince Georges aforesaid, under
            the direction of their said master &amp; owner, the said Gabriel Duval prays Judgment
            if the said Circuit Court of the District of Columbia ere will or ought to have further
            cognizance of the petition aforesaid.
