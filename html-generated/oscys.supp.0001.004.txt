         <p>Habeas corpus 
            <em>ad subjiciendum</em>. The 
            <em>mittimus</em> returned, was
            in the following form, viz.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>"District of Columbia. County of Washington, ss. Whereas
            it is represented by Sabret Scott to the subscriber, a justice of the
            peace, that his negro, Ben, has run away from his service, and
            otherwise treated him ill, and fears that the said negro Ben will
            run away again, and therefore prays a commitment for safe keeping:
            These are therefore to authorize and require you to receive
            the said Ben, and him safe keep in your jail until his said master
            releases him therefrom, or he be otherwise legally discharged.
            Given under my hand and seal this 23d day of March, 1809.
            (Signed.) John Ott. (L.S.) The marshal of the District of
            Columbia."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. F. S. Key, for the prisoner, contended that he was free by
            the judgment of this Court, rendered on the 19th of June, 1807,
            and that the writ of error did not suspend the judgment. The
            citation was not served until January 12th, 1808. No copy of
            the writ of error was lodged in the office of the clerk, for the
            master, as required by the 
            <div class="bibl code">23d section of the Judiciary Act of
               1789, [1 Stat. at Large, 73.] 
            </div> It was no 
            <em>supersedeas</em> to the execution,
            because no execution could issue. The judgment of the
            Court only ascertained the right of the negro to his freedom.
            The effect of the 
            <em>supersedeas</em> is only to stay the execution, not to
            suspend the judgment.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Jones, contrà. The writ of error was left in the office
            within the ten days, viz., on the 22d of June, 1807, and while it
            remained there, no copy was necessary for the adverse party.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court, then consisting of Cranch, C. J., and Fitzhugh,
            J., being divided in opinion, the prisoner was remanded.
         </p>

         <p>But at June term, 1809, the prisoner was brought up again by
            habeas corpus, and the Court being full he was discharged, the
            Court (Fitzhugh, J., contrà,) being of opinion that the writ of
            error could not be served so as to be a 
            <em>supersedeas</em>, unless a copy
            thereof should be lodged in the clerk's office for the adverse party
            within ten days after the judgment.
