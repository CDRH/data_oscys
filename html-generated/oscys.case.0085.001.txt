         <p>The Petition of Christopher Harris humbly represents— That in the year 1825 your petitioner
            was brought to the County aforesaid from the State of Virginia as a slave by one P.B.
            Alexander, his mistress— That the said Alexander returned to the said State of Virginia
            about six months ago leaving your petitioner in said county. That on the second day
            of February 1828 in the city of Washington in said County the said Alexander sold
            your petitioner to one Robert Rowley, a foreigner, who is about to remove your petitioner
            from this District, and now holds and claims your petitioner as his slave. That the
            said sale was within three years from the time your petitioner was brought into the
            said County to reside, and your petitioner is advised that the said sale is contrary
            to law and that he is entitled to his freedom. Your Petitioner prays your Honors to
            grant unto him the U. States writ of subpoena to said Rowley directed &amp;c. &amp;c.
