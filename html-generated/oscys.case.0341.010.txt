Baker for the said negroes. That at the time of this their <del>property</del> negroes were conveyed to the aforesaid Lloyd &amp; John W. it was intended to be a sale, but this <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> conveyance was adopted in consequence of the parties believing an absolute sale could not be made. That the application was made in the first place by the said Baker to purchase them, &amp; it was considered by this Deponent to be a sale &amp; that he did not consider himself as intitled to any return of the property.</p>
