<p>The Petition of John Baptist Lee humbly sheweth unto your Honors that he
is entitled to his freedom and is unjustly &amp; illegally held in bondage by one
Augustus Preuss who intends, (as your petitioner is informed and verily believes) to sell him a slave for life. Wherefore he prays your
Honors, that a subpoena may issue from your Honorable Court to the said
Augustus Preuss directed, commanding him to be and appear
before your Honorable Court and answer hereto. and that your
petitioner may be discharged from his service and obtain such relief in the
premises as to your Honors may seem meet. And as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;c</p>

Atty for Petr.</p>
