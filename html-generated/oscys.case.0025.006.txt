         <p>On the trial of this cause the petitioner's Counsel for the purpose of proving that
            one
            Mary Queen from whom the petitioner is supposed to be descended was of free condition
            read in
            evidence to the Jury the deposition of sundry witnesses towit, Richard
            Disney, Thomas Warfield, George Davis, Caleb
            Clarke, Freders Ryland, Richard
            Harwood, Thomas Harwood and
            Humphry Belt (here insert them from the record) and the petitioner's
            counsel further offered evidence to prove that the petitioner is lineally descended
            from said
            Mary and the Defendant moved the Court that the declaration of Jiams &amp; Lee as stated
            in the said
            depositions that Mary Queen was a free woman and that she was brought into
            this Country and sold for seven years was not admissible evidence, but the Court allowed
            the
            same to be read in evidence as admissible to prove the facts of said Mary Queen being
            a free woman and of her being brought
            into this country and of her being sold for seven years and the defendant's counsel
            offered and
            read in evidence to the Jury the following depositions towit. Joseph Lake,
            Richard Beard,
            Benjamin Welsh, Deborah Lusby and Benjamin
            Duvall (here insert them) where upon and after the arguments of Counsel upon the evidence
            were closed, the
            Defendant's Counsel prayed the Court to instruct the Jury as follows. If the Jury
            find, from the
            whole evidence that Mary Queen above mentioned, was a yellow or Tawny woman imported
            from beyond sea, and sold, and from the

            time of such importation and sale till her death actually detained in slavery;-
            That the dedication of John Jiams, as stated in the Deposition of
            Thomas Warfield, and the declaration of Lewis Lee as stated in the deposition of George
            Davis that she was a free woman, are incompetent to prove that she was entitled to
            freedom and illegally detained in slavery. Which instruction the Court refused to
            grant but instructed the Jury a follow viz.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If the Jury believed from the evidence that the petitioner is lineally descended
            in the female line from Mary
            Queen, and that the said Mary Queen was brought
            into this Country as a free woman or a servant and sold for seven years, they
            must find for the petitioner. and the declarations of Capt. Jiams that the
            said Mary Queen was a free woman and that she was brought into the Country and
            sold for seven years (as stated in the deposition of Warfield) is admissible
            evidence to prove those facts. To which 
            <span class="illegible">[decisions?]</span> refusal and instructions of the Court the Defendant excepts and prays &amp;c. And this
            his bill of exception is sealed and enrolled accordingly.
