         <p>The Court will not require in all cases an affidavit at the first term to continue
            cases of negro petitions.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This cause was continued at the cost of the defendant, as the petitioner offered himself
            ready for trail; and in general the Court will not insist on a trial at the first
            term, but if either party offers ready, it shall be continued at the cost of the party
            not ready. At the second term the Court will require a trial unless good cause be
            shown on affidavit.
