<p>In the case of David Keene's negroes now confined in Washington &amp; suing for their freedom I am requested to furnish a note on behalf of David Keene which may be used if necessary by counsel there who may each be so familiar with the Virginian Law.</p>

<p>Negroes are emancipated in Virginia under the Laws which will be found <span class="bibl citation">1 Vol. Revised Code <span class="illegible">[pa?]</span> 433 sec. 53.</span></p>

<p>It proscribes that any person by last will &amp; testament or any other instrument in writing under land  &amp; seal attested by two witnesses &amp; proved in the County or Corporation Court as acknowledged by the party in the Court of the County where he resides may emancipate his slaves.</p>

<p>In order to do so it <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> be in the <span class="illegible">[manner?]</span> prescribed by will properly proved &amp; <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> as writing proved &amp;c as acknowledged in the Court &amp;c</p>

<p>No other mode than that prescribed will be effectual. <span class="illegible">[For?]</span> it is decided that a deed recorded in a district Court (<span class="illegible">[tho?]</span> of higher <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span>) is inadmissible evidence in a suit for Freedom see <span class="bibl case">Graves &amp;c. v <span class="illegible">[Niamis?]</span> 6 Mumford 191. 201</span> <span class="bibl code">Acts of May 1782. c 21 § 1. 1803. 1814 c 103 § 6 Rhode c 111 § 53 vol. p 433</span></p>

<p>That a deed executed in Ohio but having reference to Virginia rule be void unless it conferred to the laws of <span class="bibl case">Virginia Lewis v Fullerton 1 Randolph 15. 21</span>.</p>

<p>That an instrument of Emancipation is ineffectual

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0124.009.002.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0124.009.002.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0124.009.002.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

to confer Freedom till full probate thereof be made &amp; takes effect only from the date of complete probate. See <span class="bibl case">Thrift v Hannah &amp;c 2 Leigh 300</span>. See the opinion of Judges in <span class="bibl case">Mann v Givens &amp;c 7 Leigh 707</span>.</p>

<p>It seems they cannot be emancipated by a <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> will see opinion of <span class="bibl case">Tucker &amp; Brooke</span> in <span class="bibl case">Winn v Bob &amp;c 3 Leigh 140</span></p>

<p>In this case the will is acknowledged before one witness only &amp; is therefore under the Laws of Virginia no will. See <span class="bibl code">Sessions Acts March 1835 <span class="illegible">[per?]</span> 43</span></p>

<p><span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> will is decided by the Court a Court of Competent Jurisdiction. And as this Case must <span class="illegible">[turn?]</span> on the Laws of Virginia until the decision of the Court is reversed I presume it is conclusive.</p>

<p>B W Harrison <span class="illegible">[Novr.?]</span> 1843</p>

<p>A County Court refuses to receive an instrument of emancipation to probate, can be compelled only by <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span>:

Mandamus is the remedy. <span class="bibl case">7 Leigh 689</span>.</p>

<p>There is no right of emancipation in Va. except as expressly given by the Statutes, which must be strictly <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span>. <span class="bibl case">Thrift vs Hanna 2 Leigh 300</span>.</p>

<p>Will wholly written by testator, proved by two witnesses &amp; recorded is duly executed to Emancipate Slaves. <span class="bibl case">Dunn v Amey 1 Leigh 465</span>.</p>

<p>A will not admitted to probate is not admissible evidence in favor of Petitioners for freedom. </p>
