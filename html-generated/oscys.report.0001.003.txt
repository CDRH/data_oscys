         <p>The general issue on a petition for freedom is that which puts in issue the simple
            question whether free or not.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Under the 
            <div class="bibl code">Maryland law of April, 1783, c. 23 </div>, the slave imported does not gain his freedom by the omission of the master to prove,
            to the satisfaction of the naval officer or collector of taxes, that the slave had
            resided in one of the United States three years before importation.

         <p>Petition for freedom. The cause being called for trial, and 
            no issue made up, Mr. Jones and Mr. Morsell, for the defendant, 
            asked for time to put in a plea denying the facts in the petition, 
            which were stated as the ground of the right to freedom. The 
            petition contained also a general allegation that the defendant unjustly held the
            petitioner in slavery.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>The Court said that they would receive the general issue only, 
            unless the petitioner should agree to continue the cause.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>The defendant's counsel contended that a denial of the special 
            facts was a general issue.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>But the Court (Fitzhugh, J., absent,) said the general issue was 
            that which put in issue the simple question whether free or not.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Mr. Key, for the petitioner, moved the Court to instruct the 
            jury, that they must be satisfied that the defendant made it appear to the satisfaction
            of the naval officer or collector of taxes, 
            that the slave was a resident of one of the United States, agreeably to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Maryland Act of April, 1783, c. 23 </div>, which prohibits the 
            importation of slaves generally, but excepts those who should 
            have resided three years in some of the United States; and provides that such residence
            shall be fully proved to the satisfaction 
            of the naval officer, &amp;c.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Jones, for the defendant. It is sufficient if he proves the 
            fact now, before the Court. If the defendant had satisfied the 
            collector or naval officer, he might have been still called upon to 
            prove the fact before this Court. The act is merely directory; it 
            is no part of the proviso.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Mr. Key , in reply. The legislature have expressly declared 
            that the proof of the fact shall be made before a certain officer, 
            and in a certain manner. They had probably reasons of policy 
            which required it should be so done; and the manner of proof is 
            equally essential with the substance.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court (Fitzhugh, J., absent,) directed the jury as prayed, 
            but said it was a question of some doubt, and they would hear the 
            point reargued on a motion for a new trial, if the verdict should 
            be against the defendant.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Mr. Jones, for the defendant, then offered a certificate, dated 
            June 16, 1807, (four days ago, this being June 20, 1807,) signed

            by John Barnes, the United States collector and naval officer at 
            the port of Georgetown; that the defendant had on that day 
            proved to his satisfaction that the petitioner had been a resident 
            three years, &amp;c.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Key, contended that the importation and oath must be concomitant with the coming
            in of the master. But if not, yet he 
            ought to have done it during the existence of the law (the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of 
               1783 
            </div>.) It is his own negligence if he did not. He had till 1796 
            to do it.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>The Court (Fitzhugh, J., absent,) refused to admit the certificate in evidence.</p>
         
         
         <p>The defendant then offered a like certificate signed by Richard 
            Jamieson, collector of the tax for the county of Washington, 
            dated June 12th, 1807, which was also rejected by the Court.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Verdict for the petitioner.</p> 
         
         
         <p>(Reversed in the Supreme Court. 
            <div class="bibl case">6 Cranch, 3 </div>.)
