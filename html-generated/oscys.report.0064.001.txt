Richmond, in Virginia. That he had hired a house in Washington, in this county, at first for three years, and afterwards for a term not yet expired, and continued to reside therein until his death on the 8th of November, 1834. That during such residence he purchased the petitioner in Virginia and brought him to Washington, where he resided with his master until his death. That Wilkes was considered as a citizen of the world, and before he came to Washington, had lived in Brunswick, in Virginia; sold out there, and lived in Richmond. That shortly before his death he intended, when he had made money enough, to go to the West and speculate in lands.</p>

         <p>Mr. Brent, for the petitioner, prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if they shall find, from the evidence, that Wilkes removed to this county with an intention of remaining here for an indefinite time, and as a place of present domicil, this was his place of domicil, notwithstanding he might have entertained a floating intention to go to the west at some future period.</p>

         <p>Mr. Brent in support of his prayer cited <span class="bibl treatise">Story's Conflict of Laws, 45, 48</span>, and <span class="bibl case">Bruce v. Bruce, 2 B &amp; P. 228</span>
         </p>

         <p>Mr Coxe, for the defendant, cited <span class="bibl treatise">Story's Conflict of Laws, 39, 47</span>; the <span class="bibl code">Maryland Act of 1796, c. 67, §. 4</span>, respecting sojourners and the cases <span class="bibl case">Negro William v. Sawyer, (2 Cranch C. C. 373,)</span> 
            <span class="bibl case">Negro Mary v. White, (3 Id. 663)</span>; and <span class="bibl case">Jones v. Gassaway, (2 Id. 334)</span>; <span class="bibl case">Kosciusko's case, in the Supreme Court of the United States</span>; and <span class="bibl case">Harrison v. Nixon</span>; and <span class="bibl case">Aspin's case</span>; <span class="bibl case">Almy v. Bingham, Robertson on Succession, 468</span>.</p>

         <p>The Court (Thruston, J., <em class="term">contrà</em>,) gave the instruction as prayed by Mr. Brent.</p>

         <p>Verdict for the petitioner.</p>
