<p>The petition of negro Milly humbly sheweth that your Petitioner is entitled to her freedom in consequence of being imported into the District contrary to law, &amp; also in consequence of being sold by John Gantt who had imported your Petitioner into this District to Basil Warring, within three years of her said importation: and your Petitioner hath her petition now filed &amp; depending in this Court in Washington County.</p>

Wherefore she prays your Honors for the United States writ of subpoena, &amp; also of Injunction to the said Defendants Warring &amp; Gantt directed &amp; to their servants &amp; agents, enjoining &amp; prohibiting them &amp; each of them from removing your Petitioner out of this County until her said Petition is tried
