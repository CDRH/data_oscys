Answers, that he does not recollect that she ever told him from whom or how she obtained that Information. and does not recollect he ever asked her, and he thinks the reason was, that it was generally talked of in the Neighbourhood that they were a Free Family. He never heard any of the <del>Negroes</del> Mulatto's speak of it themselves. Being asked how long he transacted business for the late Mrs. Pile, answers upwards of thirteen years; being asked what was the complexion of the aforesaid Elizabeth, commonly called Betty Mingo the great grandmother of the petitioner, answers she was a middling bright mulatto with long hair, and he knew Charles a brother of the said Betty and he had long hair, but was not so bright a mulatto as his sister; that from the appearance of the aforesaid Betty, he used to think she came of a white woman; being asked if he ever heard that the father of Betty Mingo was a white man, answers he never did, and does not believe he was because he has heard he was not. Being asked if he recollects to have heard from any person besides Mrs. Pile that Betty Mingo was descended from a white woman, answers he does not recollect that he ever did. Being asked if he recollects to have heard Mrs. Piles say, what Negro, or whose negro the said Betty's mother intermarried with, answers, he is pretty sure he has heard her say, but he cannot now recollect whose <span class="gap strikethrough">[strikethrough]</span> Negro she said he was.</p>
