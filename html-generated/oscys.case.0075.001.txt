<p>The Petition of John Baptist Lee by his mother and next
friend Joanna Lee humbly sheweth unto your Honors that he
is entitled to his freedom and is unjustly and illegally held in bondage by one
Augustus Preuss who means (as your petitioner verily
believes and is informed) to sell him a slave for life. Wherefore she prays your
honors that a subpoena may issue from your Honorable Court to the said
Augustus Preuss directed commanding him to be and appear
before your Honl Court and answer hereto and that your
petitioner may be discharged from his service and obtain such relief in the
premises as to your Honors may seem meet.</p>

<p>And as in duty bound your petitioner will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
