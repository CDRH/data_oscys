         <p>We of the Jury find that the Petioner was a Virginia born slave and held by Mrs. Graham
            the mother of the defendants intestate, as a slave in the state of Virginia untill
            the period of her death, which happened in the year 1819. That upon the death of the
            said Mrs. Graham the said slave descended to and became the property of her son 
            <del class="the said">the said</del> George Graham the defendants said intestate. That the said George Graham then resided
            in the 
            <del class="District of">District of</del> City of Washington in the District of Columbia, and sent for the said Petitioner
            with several other slaves of his, to come to the said City of Washington with the
            intention of 
            <del class="take">take</del> taking them from thence to a farm of his in the State of Kentucky
         </p>
         
         
         <p>That the petitioner was at that time hired to one John Stith in Virginia and did not
            come with the other slaves. That the said Geo. Graham sent to Mr. Stiths for the said
            
            <del class="negro William Thornton">negro William Thornton</del> Petitioner and waited in Washington several days for him, but finding that he did
            not come, the said Graham went with his other slaves to Kentucky without him, and
            on his return found the said petitioner here in Washington, and he has resided in
            Washington ever since as the slave of the said Geo. Graham.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We find that the said George Graham resided in Virginia till the year 1814 and was
            then appointed by 
            <del class="Hon">Hon</del> Mr. Monroe Chief Clerk of the War Department, and upon his 
            <span class="">[receiveing?]</span> the said appointment he came to Washington to reside, and 
            
            
            <span class="hr"> </span>

            has resided here ever since untill the period of his death which took place since
            the institution of this suit
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We find that he remained in the office of Chief Clerk of the War Department untill
            the year 1814 at which time he was a Director of the Office of 
            <span class="">[Discount?]</span> &amp; Deposits of the Bank of the U. States at Washington. That while he was a Director
            of the said office that is to say in the year 18     he was appointed President of
            the said office, and continued to act as President of the said office untill the year
            18     when he as appointed commissioner of the General Land Office and he continued
            in that office untill the period of his death.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We find that the said George Graham never intended the City of Washington as his permanent
            residence, and always declared and intended that as soon as he was out of office he
            should go to Kentucky where his people and property were. And that his said residence
            here was a sojournment, to continue so long as he remained in office under the General
            Government.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If upon this case the Law should intitle the petitioner to his freedom, then we find
            for the petitioner, but if upon the said case the law should be for the defndt. then
            we find for the defendant.
