said Gabriel Duval, in his proper person, sets down the causes following, towit: </p>

         <p>1st. Because the sd Petitioners, in their said replication, have not <del>traversed in</del> in any manner traversed, denoted, or admitted (save &amp; except a denial by way of protestation which is inadmissible) the fact that the petitioners at the time &amp; times of the filing of the said petition, and of the commencement of the same, did reside, and always before &amp; ever since have resided, and yet do reside in the County of Prince Georges aforesaid, under the direction of the said Gabriel Duval as their master &amp; owner, and not in the County of Washington aforesaid, or elsewhere in the District of Columbia aforesaid.</p>

         <p>2. Because the said Petitioners, in their said <del>petition</del> replication, have put forward a denial of a material averment in the plea of the said Gabriel Duval (namely the residence of the Petitioners) by way of protestation, and not by any direct denial or traverse, either general or special.</p>

         <p>3. Because the only fact pleaded by the Petitioners in their said replication, and therein offered or pretended to be verified &amp; put in issue, is not, ether in terms or by necessary implication, a denial or traverse of the matter above pleased by the said Gabriel Duval; nor any sufficient confession &amp; avoidance of the same.</p>

         <p>4. Because the said fact so pleased by the Petitioners in their said replication, if put forth as a traverse or <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> of the matter so pleaded by the said Gabriel Duval as aforesaid, is merely an argumentative &amp; not a direct denial or traverse.</p>

         <p>
            <del>5. Because, if the said fact so pleaded by the Petitioners he put fort as a traverse or denial either direct or argumentative of the matter so pleaded by the sd Gabriel Duval, and not as new matter pleaded by way of <span class="unclear illegible">avoidance[?]</span>, the said replication ought to have <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> to the country &amp; not with a verification.</del>
         </p>

         <p>6. Because the said replication of the Petitioners, <span class="unclear illegible">with[?]</span> the matter therein pleaded, is altogether insufficient, <span class="gap ">[]</span> and wants form.</p>

         <p>5. Because the <span class="unclear illegible">issue[?]</span> taken by the said replication is immaterial in as much as the substantial objection to the jurisdiction of the Court is not merely that the said Petitioners did <del>not</del> reside in the said County of Prince George's under the direction of the said Gabriel but also that they did not reside in the said County of Washington or elsewhere in the District of Columbia under the direction of the said Gabriel at the time of filing their said petition.</p>
