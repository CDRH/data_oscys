         <p>Geo H Gloyd being sworn in due form of law Deposeth &amp; saith, that sometime about the
            latter part of the winter, the deponent took from Mr. George Craig's house in consequence
            of an advertisement which appeared in the Independent American, a negro man named
            Walter. That the said Walter on being taken said he was contending for his freedom;
            That this deponent then carried him to the house of the said Alexander Scott, who
            reassured the said Walter, &amp; paid this deponent shortly afterwards the reward advertised
            That this deponent does not remember the conversation that took place between the
            said Alexander &amp; the said Walter, at the time this deponent delivered the said Walter
            to the said Alexander, except that the said Alexander cursed the said Walter a good
            deal.
