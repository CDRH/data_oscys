         <p>Reason 1 Because the verdict was given against the evidence.</p>
         
         
         <p>2 Because, after the Jury had retired to find their verdict, &amp; before they were called
            in Court &amp; their verdict taken by the Court, one of the Jurors held a conversation
            with Daniel Moxley, relative to the case committed to them, &amp; examined the said Moxley,
            whether or not the said negro Nelly Lemmon had lived in his family or not, as had
            been testified by one Samuel 
            <del class="Moxley">Moxley</del> Webster on the Trial.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>3 That the said Deft. since the said trial hath discovered new testimony which justified
            the belief that the said Samuel 
            <del class="Moxley">Moxley</del> Webster who testified in the said cause had been fraudulently death with, paid &amp;
            bribed by the Petitioner Nelly Lemmon to  give testimony in the said Cause &amp;c.
