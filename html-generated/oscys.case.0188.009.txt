         <p>Circuit Court District of Columbia</p>

         <p>Motion for a New Trial</p>

      </div>

      <div class="body ">

         <p>Reason 1 Because the verdict was given against the evidence.</p>

         <p>2 Because, after the Jury had retired to find their verdict, &amp; before they were called in Court &amp; their verdict taken by the Court, one of the Jurors held a conversation with Daniel Moxley, relative to the case committed to them, &amp; examined the said Moxley, whether or not the said negro Nelly Lemmon had lived in his family or not, as had been testified by one Samuel <del>Moxley</del> Webster on the Trial.</p>

         <p>3 That the said Deft. since the said trial hath discovered new testimony which justified the belief that the said Samuel <del>Moxley</del> Webster who testified in the said cause had been fraudulently death with, paid &amp; bribed by the Petitioner Nelly Lemmon to  give testimony in the said Cause &amp;c.</p>
