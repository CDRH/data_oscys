         <p>A slave brought into the county of Washington from Maryland, by his owner, and within
            three years thereafter mortgaged for his full value, does not thereby acquire a right
            to his freedom.

         <p>This was a petition for freedom, submitted to the Court by
            Mr. Key, for the petitioner, and Mr. Jones, for the defendant,
            upon a case in which it was stated that the petitioner was brought
            into this county from Maryland, by one Richards, his owner,
            and within three years thereafter was mortgaged by Richards to
            W. Bowie, who assigned the mortgage to the defendant, who
            holds the petitioner under the mortgage. That Richards became
            insolvent, and was discharged under the insolvent act of the
            District of Columbia.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The petitioner claims his freedom under the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of Maryland,
               of 1796, c. 67, §§ 1, 2, and 3 
            </div>. The first section is general, and
            prohibits the importation of slaves to reside, or for sale, and declares that if so
            imported they shall be free. The second section
            excepts slaves brought in by citizens of the United States, coming
            with a 
            <em>bonâ fide</em> intention of settling in the State; but the third
            section says that nothing in the act-contained shall be construed
            to enable any person, so removing, to sell or dispose of any slave
            so imported, unless such person shall have resided within the
            State three whole years next preceding such sale.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court (Thruston, J., not sitting,) was of opinion that
            the law was against the petitioner, and rendered judgment for the defendant.
