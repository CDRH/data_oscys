         <p>The special verdict finds in this case that the petitioners were slaves the property
            of John Marshall, in Loudon County in the State of Virginia, and upon his death, became
            the property of the Defendants in this action. if they are not entitled to freedom
            by virtue of a certain paper not in the handwriting of the deceased and attested by
            one witness, which said paper was offered for, probate by one of the executors, therein
            named, and refused and no other steps taken thereon.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Defendants contend that this paper, under the laws of Virginia, does not entitle
            to freedom, the plaintiffs that it does. The first position of Defendants is, that
            this paper, to entitle to freedom, ought to have been probated

            untill full probate be made, according to law. (see a similar decision in this court)
            in this case the deed was fully executed, with every legal requirement, the claim
            of a third party intervened before a full probate. the court decided in favor of that
            right. that the execution of a deed, accompanied by even partial probate was nothing.
            that it was a nullity untill the probate was completely consummated. See also to same

            that personal and real property, had come to the hands of the executor, sufficient
            to pay all his debts without touching his slaves, that the ex's had

            like other wills.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>A will written by testator all with his own hand, and proved to be so, by two witnesses

         <p>On the authority of this case then, the exception to the requirement of two witnesses
            to a will of emancipation is where the will is wholly in the handwriting of the testator,
            and the reason because, such a probate of a will of real estate would be sufficient.

         <p>I have shewn, that the law of Virginia, and all the dicisions are, that no deed or

         <p>A most extraordinary idea, however, seems to be started, that there are Virginia cases,
            which will carry out, what is called the intent of the Testator, in Equity in favor
            of a will the probate of which and the validity of which the law the law absolutely
            repudiates. This is, indeed, a new notion of Equity, to repeal law, all that the Courts
            of Virginia have said, is that the Courts of Equity are open to petitioners for freedom,
            as well as those of the common law That the more exact and extensive redress, which
            such tribunals are constituted, for the express purpose of affording will not be denied
            them, but that Equity can afford relief against express law, by repealing it, by allowing
            a case to be proved by one witness, which the Legislature says can be proved only
            by two, is surely, hardly, a matter of argument. This is all the cases establish,
            such is the case in 
            <div class="bibl case">5. Mumford 95. 
               <span class="illegible">[Diane?]</span> vs Johnson 
            </div>, where relief is granted against a fraudulent trial, and the case taken up anew and
            a new trial ordered. In the course of this case

            <div class="bibl case">Gilmer 333 </div>. I refer your honors particularly to this case, for

               <span class="illegible">[Diane?]</span> vs Johnson 5 Mumford 95 
            </div>, the purport of the decision is mistated. The Court below in 
            <div class="bibl case">Dempsey vs Lawrence </div> dismissed the bill, on the ground, that the petitioner could not prosecute his suit
            in Equity to a decree of freedom. the Court would enjoin untill a suit at Law could
            be carried through a being pressed for an absolute decree dismissed the bill. The
            Appellate Court reversed on the ground, not that the Petitioner was entitled to freedom,
            but because the
