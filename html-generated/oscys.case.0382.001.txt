         <p>The petition of Chloe Ann Marter, now residing in the town &amp; county of Alexa. in the District of Columbia, in behalf of herself &amp; her child named Mary Ann, who are now illegally, as your petitioner conceives, held in slavery by Elizabeth Neale of Prince George's County in the State of Maryland, respectfully sheweth. That, since the passage of the Act of Assembly of Virginia, of 17th Decr. 1792, now in force in the said County of Alexandria, entitled "an Act to reduce into one the several acts concerning slaves, free negroes and mullattoes". to wit, some time in or about the year 1809, your petitioner was brought from the said State of Maryland into the town of Alexa. aforesaid, where she has been kept (except for the period of about two years which she has spent in Maryland) ever since. &amp; particularly, that both she &amp; her said child have been kept in the said town of Alexandria from the     day of January in the year 1814

until this 11th day of May 1815, two or three days only excepted. That is to say, your petitioner has been kept in the said town of Alexandria so long, at different times, since the passage of the Act aforesaid, as amounts to four or five years; &amp; particularly both she and her said child have been kept in the said town so long, at different times during the last two years, as amounts to more than one whole year. in consequence of which, your petitioner conceives that both she and her said child are, by virtue of the aforesaid Act of Assembly of Virginia, entitled to their freedom. Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that your Honors will take her case into consideration, &amp; make such order thereupon as to your honors shall seem just &amp; right, &amp; as by the said act of Assembly is directed. &amp; your petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever pray &amp;c.

R. C. Norton, Counsel for the petitioners</p>

         <p>I believe the facts stated in the foregoing petition to be true.</p>
