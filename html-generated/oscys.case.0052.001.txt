         <p>To the Honorable the Judges of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the
            County of Washington
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The petition of Joseph Burke humbly sheweth unto your Honours that your petitioner
            is a free man, having been unlawfully imported and brought into the District of Columbia
            to reside within this district and County of Washington from the State of Virginia
            and is unjustly detained in slavery by Rachel Hoskins of the County of Fairfax in
            the State of Virginia. He therefor prays that your Honours will take into consideration
            his case, and that you will be pleased to cause the United States writ of subpona
            to issue to the aforesaid Rachel Hoskins, and that your petitioner may have a trial
            according to law, and that such other and further process may be ordered therein as
            to your honours may seem reasonable and just.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>And as in duty bound your petitioner will ever pray.</p>
