         <p>Humbly complaining sheweth unto your Honors, your Oratrix Nancy Lee by Lizette Lee her mother and next friend, that she is the daughter of Lizette Lee and the grand daughter of Joan or Joanna Lee. That the said Joanna was formerly the slave of one Anthony Addison, who in the year 1797 sold and transferred the said Joanna to the Revd Walter Addison as a servant for a period of twelve years, but with the agreement and understanding that at the expiration of that term the said Joanna should revert to and become the property of said Anthony Addison. That afterwards, and before the expiration of the term aforesaid, the said Walter Addison with the humane purpose of suffering the said Joanna to reside with her husband, exchanged the said Joanna with one Peter Savary, to whom her said husband belonged for a certain slave of said Savary named Minty; that the agreement and understanding between the said Walter Addison and said Savary was that at the expiration of the aforesaid turn of twelve years the two slaves aforesaid should be returned to their respective owners and that the issue of said Joanna, if any, should serve the said Savary, if males, until their arrival, respectively, at the age of thirty one years, and of females until their arrival, respectively, at the age of twenty five years.

and should then revert to and become the property of the said Anthony Addison. That in pursuance of the understanding and agreement aforesaid, at the expiration of the term or period aforesaid, to wit or the 18th day of October AD 1809, the aforesaid Anthony Addison by deed under his hand &amp; seal, and in due form of law (which said Deed is now on the files of this Honorable Court &amp; which she prays may be taken &amp; considered as part of this her Bill) did manumit and set free from the day of the date thereof the said Joanna and all the children of said Joanna which had been born during her being in the Service of Savary and among whom was the mother of your oratix, the males, when they should arrive at the age of thirty one years, and the females at the age of twenty five years, respectively. And your Oratix has been given to understand and verily believes that the said Peter Savary <del>was present</del> or his authorized agent, was present and consulted at the making of the said deed of manumission, and assented thereto, because your Oratix is of opinion that the period of the birth of the children severally &amp; respectively named in said deed born during the period of twelve years as aforesaid and while the aforesaid Joanna was a <del>re</del> servant &amp; resident in the family of the said Savary, and which is particularly specified in said deed of manumission, could have been known only to him or the members of his family, and was probably therefore communicated by said Savary to said Anthony Addison. And your Oratix

And your Oratrix further sheweth that the time of <del>the service of</del> servitude of the aforesaid children of said Joanna named in the deed aforesaid, or of either of them has not yet expired, but that the period for which the mother of your Oratrix has to serve under the deed aforesaid will terminate and expire at Christmas in the present year, to wit, on the twenty fifth day of December next. And your Oratrix further sheweth that the said Preuss denies the validity of the Deed of Manumission aforesaid and insists that the same is void and that the children named in said deed are each and all of them his slaves for life, and that your Oratrix also is his slave for life, and that he has the right to sell and dispose of the mother of your petitioner &amp; the other children of said Joanna and also of your Oratrix as such slaves.
