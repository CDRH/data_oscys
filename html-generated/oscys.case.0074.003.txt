         <p>Humbly complaining sheweth unto your Honors, your Oratrix Nancy Lee by Lizette Lee
            and the grand daughter of Joan or Joanna Lee. That the said Joanna was formerly the
            slave of one Anthony Addison, who in the year 1797 sold and transferred the said Joanna
            to the Revd Walter Addison as a servant for a period of twelve years, but with the
            agreement and understanding that at the expiration of that term the said Joanna should
            revert to and become the property of said Anthony Addison. That afterwards, and before
            the expiration of the term aforesaid, the said Walter Addison with the humane purpose
            of suffering the said Joanna to reside with her husband, exchanged the said Joanna
            with one Peter Savary, to whom her said husband belonged for a certain slave of said
            Savary named Minty; that the agreement and understanding between the said Walter Addison
            and said Savary was that at the expiration of the aforesaid turn of twelve years the
            two slaves aforesaid should be returned to their respective owners and that the issue
            of said Joanna, if any, should serve the said Savary, if males, until their arrival,
            respectively, at the age of thirty one years, and of females until their arrival,
            respectively, at the age of twenty five years. And
