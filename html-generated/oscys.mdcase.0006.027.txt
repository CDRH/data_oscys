Richard that he had title to the said tract of Land. And this Deponent further saith that the said Catharine Stone previous to her intermarriage with Thomas Stone father to the said David had intermarried with a certain Capt Thomas whose widow she was at the time of the said marriage with Thomas Stone and this Deponent saith that the said Captain Thomas imported into this country two free negroes who served the said Capt Thomas and Catherine Stone during their lives and that the said free negroes were both males and this Deponent apprehends from this circumstance the said petitioning negroes have assumed the said name of Thomas and have by that name claimed their freedom and further this Deponent saith not.</p>
