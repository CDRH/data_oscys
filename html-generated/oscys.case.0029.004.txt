         <p>To the Third he saith that the said Emanuel was not sold to the said Ball. In consequence of his failing to return at the time fixed on this affiant, implored his friend Capt. John C Straughan— who was going to Washington City on business of his own to have him arrested and brought back to the State of Virginia— after having been arrested as this affiant has been informed by Capt. Straughan and the said Emanuel escaped from the said Staughan— and while lurking out was exchanged by him with Mr. Henry W. Ball for a fellow of inferior value. This transaction took place in Mar 1812 to the best of this affiants recollection. To the fourth he saith— that the answer is included in that to the third Interrogatory—</p>
                
         <p>Question by the defendants agent Capt. Spencer Ball in consequence of Emanuels failure to return to <span class="unclear illegible">Northumberland[?]</span> at the time appointed— Did you consider him to be</p>
                
         <p>a run away. or did he hire himself out in Washington for your benefit? Answer — I certainly considered him a runaway. and if he hired himself out at all it was not with my permission or for my benefit</p>
