            Robert Armistead, deceased, the late master and owner of your petitioner’s mother,
            Mary Beall (Bell), having permitted said Mary Beall to go at large and free for many
            years, towit; from about the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty eight, did,
            on the fourteenth day of September, eighteen hundred and thirty five, by a good and
            sufficient deed, duly encanted and recorded in the Clerk’s office of this Court, in
            manumission Record, No 2, folios 404 and 405, declare that the said Mary Beall and

            same year, towit; in eighteen hundred and thirty five, the said Robert Armistead died;
            and Thereupon your petitioner’s mother obtained a copy of said deed duly certified
            under the seal of this Hon Court as the evidence of her freedom

            and thenceforward continued to go at large as free until the birth of your petitioner,
            towit, the third day of August, eighteen hundred and thirty nine; and for some time
            thereafter, towit; until some time in the year eighteen hundred and forty six, when
            Susan Armistead, widow of said Robert Armistead, unlawfully seized and took possession
            of your petitioner and has since held and now holds her in slavery, contrary to law
            and in violation of her rights, for the protection and enforcement whereof your petitioner
            humbly prays this Hon. Court to decree her enfranchisement and release from the condition
            of slavery, in which she is now unlawfully held by the said Susan Armistead, as aforesaid.
         </p>     
         
         
         <p>And whereas there is reason to believe that the said Susan Armistead contemplates
            removing your petitioner beyond the jurisdiction of this Hon. Court, to wit; to Norfolk
            in the State of Virginia, whereby your petitioner would be much prejudiced in the
            moveaction of her 
            <span class="">[?]</span>, she prays Your Honors to issue your forces, to restrain the said Susan Armistead
            from removing her to any place beyond the jurisdiction of this court, until your final
            decision in the premises; and for such other &amp; further relief as to Your Honors may
            seen fit.
