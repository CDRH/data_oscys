         <p>1. Was or was not Emanuel the husband of
            
            <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Violet​ ">Violette</a>
            ​ &amp; with whom did he live
            &amp; how far did he reside from Mount Zion, the
            residence of Major Gordon.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>When Elizth L. Jones—first saw
            or heard of the petitioner Emanuel he was
            (or said to be) the property of a widow Routt—of
            North. Virginia whoes Daughter
            Catherine Routt—married William
            Claughton of said county—and Emanuel—the became the property of Mr
            Claughton—whoes second marriage—was with one Captain
            Blackwell—and whom died shortly after
            sd marriage—(that is within
            twelve months—) in the Autumn of 1811—leaving two Daughters by her first
            marriage—and two infants by her last—Emanuel—was considered the property of the
            orphans above mention'd—But how that business was conducted—Elizth L.
            Jones does not know—and only adds—that Mr
            Blackwells— residence from Mount
            Sion was about 3 miles—where Emanuel lived during her life time.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>2d. Did Major William
            Ball ever see or find Violet
            <del class="te">te</del> before the
            9th July 1811?
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Elizth L. Jones—did not hear of
            Major Balls making any inquiry about
            Violet—altho he was at Mr Gordons
            before the 9th of July
            1811 and after
            Violet was initiated as a domestic in Mr
            Gordons family— who was passing about the House without any
            issue respecting who sh- see her—
         </p>
         
         
         <p>3d. Was notice ever given by yourself of Major
            Gordon or by any other person
            to your knowledge to the defendant Henry W. Ball
            or to Major W Ball of
            
            <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Violet​ ">Violette</a>
            ​
            being at the house of Major Gordon being between
            the time of her coming to Virginia &amp; the 9th July 1811.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It never occur'd to Elizth L. Jones—as being necessary for her to give notice to
            Henry W.
            Ball—that Violet—was employed as a
            Domestic in the family of William
            Gordon—Nor does she suppose that Mr Gordon, or any other person deem'd it
            necessary—as he had made it an object of special business to see Major
            Ball—on the subject of
            Violets being for sale—Therefore there was nothing to give
            notice to Major Ball—about
            Violet—as he must have sanction'd her going to Mr.
            Gordons in the Capacity of a domestic in that gentlemans family.

         <p>Early in October 1811— Violet
            together with her two children Winifred &amp;
            Chloe
            left North. and return'd to the
            City of Washington.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>× Elizth L. Jones— heard Mr William Gordon observe one morning, at Breakfast—, to
            Mrs Gordon that he shd. go that day, to see Major
            Ball suspecting
            Violets being
            for sale—and if she was that he sd. endeavor to purchase her— Mr Gordon left
            Home that day as he had mention and some short time after that— (perhaps the
            same week) Violet and her children—
            Winifred &amp; Chloe arrived at
            Mount Sion and Violet was initiated
            into the service of Mr. Gordons family
         </p>
         
         
         <p>× Mr H W Ball did not deny
            (having sent Violet &amp; her children to
            Northumberland
            for his Brother Major William Ball to
            dispose of them by sale— But to whom or where he was instructed to sell them
            is impossible for Elizth L. Jones to say as she has before &amp; herein
            stated.—) Jones conferred with him on that subject—) and as to her
            making any inquiry of him whether his brother— was acting agreeable to his
            instructions or not—Elizth L. Jones having no reason to
            doubt it— there fore— did not ask H W Ball whether he did or did not—nor did
            he take occasion— to say— that he 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> his Brother— yet the
            presumption was that he did— But certain it is— that he did not deny it,

         <p>On this 3rd day of June AD 1814 Personally
            appeared before me the subscriber, Elizabeth L. Jones &amp;
            made oath to the truth of the answers to the Interrogatories proposed on the
