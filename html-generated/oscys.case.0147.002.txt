<p>That the petitioner is one of the slaves named and demised in that clause of the said will, which is in the words following to wit:</p>

<p>"I also give and bequeath to my nephew Gerad T. Greenfield, all my negro slaves namely, Ben, Manson, James, Henry, George, Lewis, Rebecca, Kitty, Sophia, Mary, Elizabeth, Nathaniel, and Maria, also Toney, Billy, Betty &amp; Anne. Provided he shall not carry them out of the state of Maryland, or sell them to <del>either</del> any one, in either of which events I will and desire the said negroes to be free for life."

<p>To the Honorable the Ch. Justice of the United States of America.</p>

<p>The petition of William H. Williams of Washington City in the District of Columbia respectfully shews. That in the month of December last he purchased of one Gerrard T. Greenfield a negro man named James Ash, with notice that the said Greenfield claimed the said negro under the will of Maria A Greenfield late of Prince Georges County deceased, &amp; that the said Maria had by a proviso in her will restricted the right of said Gerrard to sell the said negro to any one or to remove him from the state of Maryland, a restriction which she in like manner imposed upon the said Gerrard as legatee of sixteen other negroes in her said will. Your petitioner was also informed that the said Gerrard had been advised that such restriction upon the right to dispose of the property given him by the said will, being repugnant to the nature of the estate given, was void, &amp; that his object in selling the negro James Ash was to obtain a judicial decision on that question. The negro James was therefore informed of the sale <span class="unclear illegible">[&amp;?]</span> an opportunity give him to commence a suit for his freedom. Your petitioner was fully indemnified in the event of a decision in favour of the freedom of the said negro.</p>

<p>Your petitioner further shews that the said Negro James did commence his said suit &amp; the same was tried at the term of the <del>said</del> Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for Washington County which closed its sittings on Friday the 1st of this month &amp; the Judgment of this said Court in said cause being against your petitioner he feeling himself aggrieved thereby, did pray an appeal, but was much as the said negro is now of the value of one thousand dollars your petitioner cannot have the benefit of his appeal without an order from one of the Justices of the Supreme Court directing the same to be allowed. Your petitioner therefore believing that there is Error in the Judgment of this said Circuit Court as the said cause &amp; that such error involves a question of Law important to the slave states &amp; therefore of such extensive intent as to render a final decision of the same by the Supreme Court of the United States

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0147.002.007.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0147.002.007.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0147.002.007.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

desirable, respectfully lays before your Honor a copy of the proceedings complained of, &amp; prays that the same may be considered, &amp; that your Honor would direct such order to the clerk of the said Circuit Court as will enable your Petitioner to remove the said cause by appeal to the Supreme Court. &amp; he will pray.</p>

<p>&amp; your petitioner asks leave to suggest the following as a sufficient cause why such order should be allowed.</p>

<p>That on the decision of the case of James Ash the Circuit Court have held virtually that the <del>Law</del> rule of Law which would have been applied in the trial of the right to any other property was inapplicable to a case in which the right of a negro to freedom was involved, it having been conceeded on all hands that if the bequest had <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> to others than negro property with a devise over in case of sale or removal, the devise over <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> have been <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> depending on a repugnant condition. or if Maria A Greenfield had, instead of giving freedom to the negroes, in the event of their being sold or removed given them in such event to some third person that the devise ever would have been void for the same reason.</p>

<p>In addition to which your petitioner may suggest that the value of the property affected by the decision of James's case is very considerable as appears by the clause of the will under  which he claims his freedom.</p>

<p>he further takes leave to refer to the case of <span class="bibl case">Bradley vs <span class="unclear illegible">[Paixoto?]</span> 3 <span class="unclear illegible">[Ves?]</span>: 324.</span></p>

<p>May 5, 1840</p>

<p>To William Brent Clerk of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Washington</p>

<p>You are hereby directed to issue the writ of error prayed for in the foregoing petition, upon the terms and conditions prescribed by law. </p>
