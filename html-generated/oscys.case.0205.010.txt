<div class="body ">

<p>Because in the record and proceedings as also in the rendition of the judgment of a plea which is in the said Circuit Court before you or some of you, between Sarah Ann Allen for herself and children Eliza Jane, Julia Maria &amp; John Davey, Petitioners, and Joseph Wallingsford defendant, a manifest error hath happened to the great damage of the said Joseph Wallingsford as by his complaint appears. We being willing that error, if any hath been, should be duly corrected, and full and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid in this behalf, do command you, if judgment be therein given, that under your seal distinctly and openly, you send the record and proceedings aforesaid, with all things concerning the same, to the Supreme Court of the United States, together with this writ, so that you have the same at Washington on the first Monday of August next, in said Supreme Court, to be then and there held; and that the record and proceeding aforesaid being inspected, the said Supreme Court may cause further to be done therein to correct that error, which of right and according to the laws and the custom of the United States should be done.</p>

<p>Witness the Hon John Marshall, Chief Justice of the said Supreme Court.</p>
