            <del>dren</del> by paying to him a certain sum of money. &amp; within a year from this time solicited Mr Turner thru Miss Magruder, to permit her said daughter Rachel to hire herself in Georgetown her wages to be received for the use of the Turners in Fredericktown.</p>

         <p>The the facts aforesaid, if believed by the Jury from the evidence are sufficient in law to repeal the presumption (stated in the Petitioners' prayer in the Dfts first Bill of exceptions) that the said Turner had at any time manumitted &amp; set free this said Ellen, <del>Phoebe &amp; Rachel or either of them,</del> by deed or otherwise, &amp; that without such presumption, the said Petitioners Ellen <del>John, Robert &amp; Louisa</del> is <del>are</del> not entitled to a verdict in their favour; which instruction as prayed by the Dft the Court gave</p>

         <p>To which said instruction the <del>Pet</del> Petitioners except and this their bill of exceptions is signed sealed and ordered to be enrolled this 12th of Decr. 1849.</p>
