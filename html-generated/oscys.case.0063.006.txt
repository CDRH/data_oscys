            6 June 1825
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Sir:</p>
         
         
         <p>Mr Key must have misunderstood my meaning, in my observation to him relatively to
            the employment of slaves on board of our national ships. I intended to convey to him
            the idea, not that there was any law or rule prohibiting their employment, but that
            the practice of the service, as I thought, discountenanced their employment. In this
            I believe I am correct: for, altho' they are sometimes employed as servants to officers
            to whom they belong, they are all entered on the muster &amp; pay rolls of the ships,
            as free persons are, &amp; are never, I believe, marked as slaves.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>I am very respy sir, yr mo. ob. servt.
            <br></br>
