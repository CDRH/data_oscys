         <p>William Brent makes on the holy Evangels of Almighty God that to the best of his Knowledge
            and belief, when the writ of error sued out in this case was brought to his office
            (nor at any time afterwards) was there any copy thereof left at his said office for
            the adverse party— nor was any such copy  thereof ever directed to be made out in
            his said office. 
            <del class="nor was any such ever made out.">nor was any such ever made out.</del> That the copy now among the papers in the said cause was made out for his own convenience.
            That it is a copy of the said writ of error &amp; the endorsement on 
            <span class="torn page">[torn page]</span> is a copy of the endorsement on the said writ of error. &amp; That he cannot state at
            what precise time the said copy was made, but that it was previous to the said writ
            &amp; record annexed to it, being sent up to the Supreme Court
         </p>
