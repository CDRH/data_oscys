The Counsel states that if the facts are supported of which <del>they</del> he has strong evidence she is entitled to her freedom under the Laws of this county, and also according to the Laws of Maryland.

He has taken considerable pains to understand the right of the said Lucket to her freedom, and he is of the opinion that she is entitled to it. That <del>her</del> since her right to freedom has accused the <del>defendant</del> plaintiff has had a child born unto her.</p>
