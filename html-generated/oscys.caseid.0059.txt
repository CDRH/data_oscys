         Case Narrative
         
         
         <p>On August 4, 1823 Fanny Tarlton filed a petition for freedom on behalf of herself
            and her children. She argued that because Alexander Scott took her to Caracas and
            returned over a year later she was entitled to her freedom under the 
            <div class="bibl code">Maryland Act of 1796 </div> barring importation of slaves. Alexander Scott was appointed by President James Madison
            in 1811 as an agent on a  "secret mission" to Caracas, and he took Fanny Tarlton to
            Venezuela where he was stationed sometime between 1811 and 1813. He then returned
            with her to Maryland and then moved back into Washington, D.C. The court ruled that
            a special agent of the government with a necessarily uncertain term of residency does
            not upon return violate the terms of importation in the Maryland Act. It is possible
            that Alexander Scott sold Fanny Tarlton and her children to Cartwright Tippett sometime
            after 1813.
