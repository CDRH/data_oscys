<p>To the Honorable the Judges of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Washington.</p>

<div class="body ">

<p>The Petition of David Africana humbly sheweth that he is
entitled to his freedom and is unjustly held in bondage by John Strother, who holds and claims your Petitioner and (as he is informed and believes) means to sell him as a slave. Wherefore he prays your Honors that a Subpoena may be issued, to the said John Strother directed, that he may appear &amp; answer hereto, and that your Petitioner may be discharged from his service, and obtain such relief in the premises, as to your Honors may seem right.</p>

<p>Simms for Petitioner</p>

<p>On the prayer of the Petitioner, who proved that he <del class="was a Slave">was a Slave</del> knew the Petitioner living as the property of one Davis in the State of Virginia about 10 or 11 years ago, &amp; that he was <del class="brought">brought</del> seen &amp; known here <del class="by">by</del> about 6 or 7 years ago &amp; has resided here ever since as the Slave of Deft</p>

<p>That the above facts, if believed by the Jury, are prima facie evidence of the
Petitioner's claim to freedom.</p>
