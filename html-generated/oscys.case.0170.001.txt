<p>Your petitioner humbly sheath that her mother Ellen Kennedy was in or about the year 1812 carried from the state of Virginia into the City of Baltimore and state of Maryland and was then contrary to the laws of the said state sold within a year after she was so imported to Benjamin Buck <del>that your petitioner was afterwards born,</del> and the said Ellen her mother filed her petition in the Court of Baltimore County for her freedom <del>but</del> after which your petitioner was born. That the said Petition being heard by the said Court was decided in favor of the said Petition &amp; she was thereupon discharged from slavery. Your petitioner continued to reside in the family of the said Benjamin Buck <del>for</del> until sometime about the year 1828 when she removed to this city whither her mother had already come, and has continued to reside here without the slightest concealment or effort as concealment and as she believes with the full knowledge of the said Benjamin Buck

from that time to the present date, when she was yesterday most unexpectedly arrested, as she hath heretofore stated to your Honors.</p>
