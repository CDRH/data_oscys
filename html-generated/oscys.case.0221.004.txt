Petitioner that she would make oath to what she had stated, yet that she had since, and within a few days, promised to her son in law, Mr. Sayers, that she would never again set her hand to paper, or make an oath in any case: she alleged that all she had said, was true but by reason of her promise, she would not swear to it. Her testimony could not therefore be taken, and a return of the fact is made accordingly.</p>
