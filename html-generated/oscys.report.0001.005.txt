         <p>The cause was argued by C. Lee and Jones, for the plaintiff in error, and by Swann
            and F. S. Key, for the defendant.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Marshall, C. J., delivered the opinion of the court, as follows, namely:</p>
         
         
         <p>In this case three opinions were given by the circuit court, to each of which the
            defendant in that court excepted. These opinions were, in substance,
         </p>
         
         
         <p>1. That the master of a slave imported into the state of Maryland, while the act,
            passed in the year 1783, entitled, 
            <div class="bibl code">"An act to prohibit the bringing slaves into this state," </div> was in force, could not be admitted to prove the fact that such slave had resided
            three years, previous to his importation into Maryland, in some one of the United
            States, unless he could show that this fact had been proved to the satisfaction of
            the naval officer, or collector of the tax.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>2. That a certificate made by the naval officer and collector of the port of Georgetown,
            dated on the 16th day of June, in the year 1807, certifying that this fact was proved
            to his satisfaction on that day, did not satisfy the law.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>3. That a similar certificate given by the collector of the tax for the county of
            Washington did not satisfy the law.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The correctness of these opinions is to be tested by comparing them with the act under
            which the plaintiff in the court below claimed his freedom.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The enacting clause of that law prohibits the importation of slaves into the state
            of Maryland, and gives freedom to such as shall be imported contrary to that act.
            A proviso excepts from the operation of the enacting clause those slaves which, having
            resided for three years within some one of the United States, and being the property
            of the importer, should be imported into the state of Maryland by a person intending
            to become a resident thereof, and who should actually reside therein for the space
            of twelve months thereafter. The act then adds—and the residence of such slave in
            some one of the United States for three years as aforesaid, antecedent to his coming
            into this state, shall be fully proved to the satisfaction of the naval officer, or
            collector of the tax, by the oath of the owner, or some one or more credible witness
            or witnesses.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By the plaintiff in error it is contended, that this part of the law is directory;
            that it prescribes a duty to the importer of a slave within the description of the
            proviso, but does not make his title to that slave dependent on the performance of
            this duty.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By the defendant it is contended, that this clause forms a part of
            
            
            <span class="hr"> </span>

               </a>
            </span>
            
            the proviso, and that the fact of previous residence within some one of the United
            States can be proved by no other testimony, if that which is here prescribed be wanting.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The act, in its expression, is certainly ambiguous, and the one construction or the
            other may be admitted, without great violence to the words which are employed.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The great object of the proviso certainly was to permit persons, actually migrating
            into the state of Maryland, to bring with them property of this description which
            had been within the United States a sufficient time to exclude the danger of its being
            imported into America for the particular purpose. The great object of the provision
            was, that the fact itself should accord with this intention. The manner in which that
            fact should be proved was a very subordinate consideration. Certainly the provisions
            of the law ought not to be so construed as to defeat its object, unless the language
            be such as absolutely to require this construction.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It would be a singular and a very extraordinary provision that a naval officer, or
            the collector of a tax, should be made the sole judge of the right of one individual
            to liberty, and of another to property. It would be equally extraordinary that the
            oath of one of the parties, probably in the absence of the other, should be conclusive
            on such a question. It would be not less strange that the manner in which this quasi
            judge should execute his duty should not be prescribed, and that not even the attempt
            should be made to preserve any evidence of his judgment.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>These considerations appear to the court to have great weight; and the language of
            the law ought to be very positive to deprive them of their influence.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Upon an attentive consideration of that language, the majority of the court is of
            opinion, that the property of the master is not lost by omitting to make the proof
            which was directed, before the naval officer, or the collector of the tax, and that
            the fact on which his right really depends may be proved, notwithstanding this omission.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The words of this part of the section do not appear to the court to be connected,
            either in their sense, or in their mode of expression, with the proviso. It is a distinct
            and a substantive regulation. In legislation, the conjunction "and" is very often
            used when a provision is made in no degree dependent on that which precedes it; and,
            in this case, no terms are employed which indicate the intention of the legislature,
            prescribing this particular duty, to make the right to the property dependent on the
            performance of that duty.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It is, then, the opinion of the majority of the court, that the fact of
            
            
            <span class="hr"> </span>
            <span class="pageimage">

            the residence of the plaintiff below within the United States was open for examination,
            even had his master omitted entirely to make the proof of that residence before the
            naval officer, or collector of the tax, and, consequently, that the circuit court
            erred in refusing to admit testimony respecting that fact.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The opinion of the court on this point renders a decision on the other exceptions
            unnecessary.
