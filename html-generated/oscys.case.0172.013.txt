         <p>2. On the ground of newly discovered evidence</p>
         
         
         <p>And the Petitioner submits to the court that she has since the trial of the said cause
            learned and will be able to shew by competent proof that, the said Defendant in the
            life time of her said Husband treated him with great 
            <del class="cru">cru</del> neglect and cruelty; that for more than two years before he went to the alms House
            the said Defendant and her said husband did not live together as man and wife; that
            they were reduced to such poverty as to be obliged to ask, and did in fact ask alms
            in their neighborhood: that the said Robert Armistead after his 
            <del class="death">death</del> coming from the alms House and before his death was beged, and solicited by the Defendant
            to revoke the said deed, and there he uniformly and steadily refused to do so declaring
            that he had made the said deed of his own accord it was in the clerks office and he
            would not change it: and that the said Edward W. Clarke who it was alleged was mainly
            instrumental in proving the Execution of said deed was sick and confined to his bed
            from some time in

            <del class="that she could">that she could</del> during the said trial of witnesses by whom she could prove them, she could no then
            procure the attendance of said witnesses, and she hath since the said trial discovered
            the said proof.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>I state that the foregoing proof in substance has ben discovered thereof the directions
            Given by myself, and by active Exertions of which the Petition had no knowledge, and
            I have seen witnesses, and their evidence to prove each one of the said facts, except
            one, that at present depends upon hearsay but I have good cause to believe and so
            believe it can be proved by living witnesses. I have the evidence of that fact from
            the statements made by two witnesses now dead, there are other said to be living.
