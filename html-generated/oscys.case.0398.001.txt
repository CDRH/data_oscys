The court doth assign R. I. Taylor as Counsel for the Petitioners to state the facts of the case on which they rest their claim and to report  the same to this court. Whereupon the said R. I Taylor returned (the following) statement of facts with his opinion therein. *</p>

         <p>It appears from the evidence of William Simms that some time in the year 1796 he entered into a contract with one Alexander Smith for the purchase of the Petitioner Dorcas for a Term of years <span class="gap strikethrough">[strikethrough]</span> the said Alexander being then the owner of the said Slave.

The slave Dorcas was accordingly <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> in the possession of the said Simms but from in <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> rather than assign the deed of emancipation was not executed. after holding the said Dorcas for some years the said W.

            <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> to one Timothy Carrington, with whom the said Dorcas served out her Term and was then discharged by him as a free woman.</p>

         <p>During her servitude with Carrington she had two children one of whom named Fanny is now in the possession of the said Isaac Kell, after her Term had expired she had three other children one of whom is the slave Julia now in the possession of Rector Lowe, who however claims no right to her &amp; is desirous of surrendering her the slave Fanny was purchased from the Executors of Carrington by Isaac Kell, the said purchase was made after the mother had been discharged as free, and the said Isaac had for a long time previously been intimate in the said Carrington, family and was married to one of his daughters, from which consideration a notice of the rights of the said Fanny may be fairly inferred to have been <span class="unclear illegible">received[?]</span> by the said Isaac the <del>slaves</del> negroes Dorcas and Julia are claimed by the said James Smith on behalf of the said Alexander Smith is as a volunteer under him From all which circumstances it is the opinion of the subscriber that the said Dorcas Fanny and Julia, have an equitable claim to their freedom such as would be decreed in <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> by a Court of Chancery and that they ought to be permitted to sue for the same agt the said James Smith &amp; Isaac Kell.</p>
