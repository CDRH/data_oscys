            he was the property of defendant's &amp; my father, who died about the year 1810 or 1811
            and under his will was assigned to the defendant who has since owned said slave. Said
            slave was 
            <del class="born and">born and</del> raised in Caroline County of the State of Maryland and as I have always understood
            was there born. I have heard from others of his having left the state and county of
            late years, but having during this period been a resident of Boston I have no personal
            knowledge on the subject.

         </p>
         
         
         <p>To the 4th Interrogatory she answers, It may be material to say that on my return,
            on a visit to Caroline County, on being informed that the petitioner had gone to Virginia,
            I remonstrated with the defendant for having suffered it and ascertained that his
            going thither and continuance there were greatly against her will and beyond her control.

         <p>To the 1st Cross interrogatory she answers. Miss Purnell has two sisters and several
            nephews &amp; nieces of deceased brothers &amp; sisters who it is supposed would inherit her
            property in the event of her death without a will. &amp; I have the strongest reason to
            believe that she has made no will.
