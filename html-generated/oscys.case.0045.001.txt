         <p>The petition of Richard Luckett, a negro man of the 
            County of Washington, District of Columbia 
            aforesaid, humbly sheweth unto your Honours, that sometimes about the year
            1782 or 3 your petitioner was held and owned by a certain Thomas Macubbin 
            of Montgomery County, State of Maryland. That 
            while so held and owned by the said Thomas Macubbin he the said Thomas 
            removed to the State of Virginia and removed and imported into the 
            said State of Virginia your petitioner to reside. That upon such 
            importation the Acts of Assembly of the State of Virginia required 
            a certain Affidavit to be made by the said Thomas and in the absence of 
            such Affidavit gave freedom to your petitioner That the said Thomas neglected 
            &amp; omitted to make such Affidavit whereby your petitioner acquired title to freedom.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>That after the said Thomas had resided and held said petitioner 
            in the State of Virginia eight or nine years, he removed to the 
            State of Maryland and removed and imported your petitioner into the State of 
            Maryland, to reside and neglected &amp; omitted to comply

            to comply with certain requisites contained in certain Acts of Assembly 
            of the State of Maryland prohibiting the importation 
            of Slaves into the State of Maryland then in force. That 
            if your petitioner had not acquired a title to freedom under the laws of 
            the State of Virginia by his removal to the said State, 
            then he would have acquired title to freedom by his importation to reside 
            in the State of Maryland
         </p>
         
         
         <p>That your petitioner came to the possession of a certain Janet Lingan 
            who now sets up claim to him under some pretended or aledged purchase or bequest 
            or descent and that your petitioner is now unjustly and illegally held in bondage
            
            by the said Janet Lingan.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Your petitioner prays your Honours to take his case into consideration and to grant
            
            him a fair &amp; impartial trial according to the Law of the Land and your 
            petitioner will ever pray and so forth
