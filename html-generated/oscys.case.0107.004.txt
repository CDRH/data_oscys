         <p>On this second day of June AD 1843, in open court, personally appears the above named
            petitioner, and being duly sworn deposeth and saith: That since the trial of the above
            entitled cause, he the petitioner hath discovered new evidence material proper and
            competent to be used by the said Petitioner in support of the issue on his part 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> in the said cause: and that at the time of the trial thereof he the petitioner was
            ignorant that the said evidence was within the jurisdiction of this court, or could
            be addressed by him on the said trial. By which said evidence the said petitioner
            expects to prove that he was in fact hired in the state of Virginia at the time of
            the removal of his owner Mrs Martha Graham, from the state aforesaid into this County,
            and that he continued so to be hired, and actually remained in the said state more
            than twelve

            months after such removal: so that he the petitioner was in fact unlawfully imperiled
            into the said County and is entitled to his freedom. That since the trial of the said
            cause the said petitioner has accidental become acquainted with the fact that 
            <del class="the">the</del> one of the persons to whom he was so hired in the state of Virginia is now living
