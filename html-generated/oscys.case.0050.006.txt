<p>William a colored man vs. Lemuel Sawyer</p>

</div>

<div class="body ">

<p>Be it remembered that in this cause, on the trial thereof the plaintiff introduced a witness who proved that when he served the process in this case on the defendant, the said defendant stated that he had bought the plaintiff in the district from a man named Valentine Peyton, who had come on a visit to the district from Wheeling in Virginia that he had taken a bill of sale for the said plt that the price was $325: that in a day or two, or two or three days, the defendant who was a member of Congress from North Carolina, had sent him by the steam boat to Norfolk in Virginia where he was to remain, until he the deft should arrive.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The plaintiff also exhibited <del class="a letter">a letter</del> as evidence a letter which the defendant admitted to have been written by him which letter, addressed to "Captain Jenkins, Potomac," and subscribed L Sawyer is in the words following to wit (<span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> the letter verbatim</p>

<p>which <del class="evidence">evidence</del> being all the evidence offered in on the part of the plaintiff the deft by his counsel doth demur <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> as insufficient in law to support the said plaintiffs case as set forth in the <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> Petitioner: wherefore he prays that the Jury may be discharged from rendering their verdict, in this Case, until the matter of law can be heard: <del class="wherefore the plf avers that the evidence aforesaid is sufficient &amp; prays the Judgment of the Court thereon">wherefore the plf avers that the evidence aforesaid is sufficient &amp; prays the Judgment of the Court thereon</del></p>

<p>* The plf further proved that Valentine Peyton, soon after  the sale left the City, and in debt, and has <del class="never">never</del> not returned: that the plf was sold by <span class="illegible">[Poor?]</span> as an auctioneer, and was <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> on board the steam boat &amp; sent away immediately: that he was <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> on board the steam boat that same day

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0050.006.002.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0050.006.002.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0050.006.002.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

and the price was afterwards paid: that <del class="Plf">Plf</del> Peyton told the plaintiff when he was <del class="going to">going to</del> at the steam boat <del class="or at">or at</del> wharf it, that he would meet him down the river.— perhaps at Chapters.</p>

<p>But the Court refused to discharge the Jury <del class="and required">and required</del> and refused to require the plt to join in the demurrer, unless the defendant would admit such facts as might be fairly referred by the Court from the evidence aforesaid: which facts were (1) that the Petitioner was brought into the district with intent to sell him (2) that there is no other claimant of the petitioner in existence: 3. That he was secretly sold without the power of claiming his freedom and removed from the district immediately after the sale <span class="illegible">[with a?]</span> view to prevent his claiming his freedom: which facts the defendant refused to admit: whereupon the Court decreed the trial to proceed before the Jury: to which opinion &amp; direction of the Court the deft by his Counsel <del class="objects">objects</del> Excepts, and prays the Court to sign &amp; seal this his bill of exceptions in order that the same may be made part of the record in this cause.</p>

<p>Capn Jenkins ought not <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> brought back my negroe. He was not free, but a lying rascal. He passd here a whole winter, as the slave of V. Peyton, was advertised &amp; sold to me by Mr <span class="illegible">[Poor?]</span>, &amp; carried on board, <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> delivered to my agent in Norfolk. If he <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> on board again (as he is now run away) I hope he will not get off so easy, <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span>  be delivered to Lee, or some one in Norfolk, who will not mind the fellows tales. &amp; sell him, &amp; deposit the money in Bank for me. The money must not be pasd into any other persons hands but <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> in Bank; I would nto  deliver his trunk, but keep it like your passager money is paid. Can you bring me up &amp; over <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> from <span class="illegible">[Garrison &amp; Co.?]</span></p>
