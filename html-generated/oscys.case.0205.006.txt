That <del>they</del> he has so known her for about nine years. That she always since her manumission went about &amp; lived &amp; received her wages as a free woman &amp; maintained herself &amp; her children. That she went about openly as a free person. That her said mistress resided in Washington City for some years before the manumission &amp; afterwards till shortly before her death which happened ten or eleven months ago.
