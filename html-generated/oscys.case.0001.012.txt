            Taxes &amp;c. prior to the 3d. day of July in the year 1786 did, on or about that day
            Seize on &amp; Distrain the aforesaid Negro Terry, then in the possession of him the said
            Thomas Ray, &amp; in the said County of Fairfax, which said Negro woman Terry then had
            an Infant Child in her arms, which this Depot. afterward was Informed, was a male,
            &amp; named Benjamin. (not at that time finding any other property, of which said Taxes
            &amp;c could be levied and made). On the same day that this depot. so distrained on the
            said Terry for arrears of Taxes &amp;c. He served an Execution, or 
            <span class="illegible">[Ca sa:?]</span> on the baby of him the said Thomas Ray at the suit of a Certain Samuel Hepburn. The
            said Ray not being able (as appeared) to Discharge the Debt &amp; both calld. for by said
            Execution, proposed to this depot. that he was Desirous the negros Terry and Benja.
            Should be Immediately sold first to Discharge the Taxes &amp;c so in arrear, Secondly
            to Discharge the said Execution, &amp; lastly that the Depot. should pay to him the said
            Ray, or to his order the overplush, or access, if any which should be procered by
            &amp; from the sale of said Terry &amp; Benjamin. and for that purpose did on said 3d. day
            of July aforesaid 
            <del class="did">did</del> sign a writing dated on said 3d July 1786, a True Copy of which is hereto hereto
            annexed, &amp; is Marked A. On the 8th day of he same month (July) 1786, this depot. sold
            the said Terry &amp; Benjamin at Public Auction, at the Courthouse, then in Alexandria,
            at which time the aforesaid Sabrit Scott became the purchaser as the Highest Bidder,
            of said Terry &amp; Benja. for the sum of forty eight pounds Vira. Currency. Out of which
            proceeds, the Taxes &amp;c so in arrear, was first settled, then the amount of the Execution
            aforesaid, was settled, and the then Remaining Ballance, paid over to the said Ray,
            who signed a rect. for the same endorsed upon the said paper marked A, and now truly
            Copied upon the annexed copy of the same. Another paper also hereto annexed, Marked
            B. is in the hand writing of this Deponent, (purporting to be a Bill of Sale) was
            drawn up by him, at the Instance of the said Scott, about the time of the said sale.
            this deponent does not know why it was not Executed by the said Ray. It Recites the
            Circumstances of the Sale honestly, Except, that it 
            <span class="illegible">[omits?]</span> to mention the Execution which the said Ray had by his former writing had Consented
            should be satisfied out of the Sale this Deponent Recollects that the Child of said
            Terry (aforesaid) at the time of the sale was of a yellow color, was an infant in
            the arms of Terry

            of Terry, he believes was a sucking Infant, apparently from six to nine months old.
            The last list of Taxable property given by the said Ray, in said Fairfax County, that
            this depot. knows of, was in the year 1784 as before stated. and in that list, no
            mention is made of any such negro as Benja. but the negro Soloman Terry was therein
            mentioned.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This depot. further states, on the Interogoterry Mr. Key the Petitioners Councill
            (as he is Informed) that in the year 1785, he did not, to his present Recollection,
            see the said Ray, or Call on him to Collect his Taxes &amp;c. &amp; understood that the said
            Thos. Ray had gone to Maryland. This, this depot. at present 
            <span class="illegible">[gets?]</span> his Information from a note made in his Sheriffs book, opposite said Rays account
            stated therein. And at the time when he Distrained on the negros as before mentioned,
            &amp; served the Execn. or 
            <span class="illegible">[Ca Sa?]</span> on the said Ray, he had been Informed, that the said Thos. Ray was about leaving
            the County &amp; going to the state of Maryland, &amp; carrying his aforesaid negroes with
            him. This depot. further saieth that if he had of known where to have found the propy.
            of the said Ray in the County aforesaid, after having so understood he was gone to
            the State of Maryland, he certainly should of Distrained, or Endeavourd. to 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> distrained for the purpose of making the Taxes &amp;c aforesaid. This Depot. doth not
            know whether the said woman Terry, or her Child Benjamin were carried to the State
            of Maryland, at any time Between 1784 &amp; the Third of July 1786. Either of his Knowledge,
            or from any Recollected Information, this Depot. further states, that sometime past,
            perhaps about the time of the Institution of this suit, or  short time afterwards,
            a young negro man calld. on him at his House in Fairfax County, and then produced
            to this Depot. a letter, or writing, purporting an Enquiry of me on the Subject of
            Terry &amp; her Son Benja. (Who the said negro man said he was). Perhaps the writing was
            from his Council, but at present do not perfectly Remember. at which time I gave a
            Certificate of what I that time Rememberd. on the subject,  but at this time do not
            Recollect how far it went to the Relation thereof, but since this Depot. hath been
            summd. as an Evidence in the suit aforesaid, he hath procured the Information before
            set forth in this Deposition &amp;c from His Tax &amp; Sheriffs Books, Commissrs. Books the
            Records of Fairfax County Court, &amp; writings in his possession, herein Refered to.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>On the further Interogry. of the Defts. Councill, This Depot. states that he had a
            Deputy Assistant Collector &amp;c viz: Joseph Powell who acted for him in 1785 &amp; 1786
            in that part of the County where the said Ray Resided, or had resided, for which reason
            I am not able to say, with Certainty, whether any or what Search was by him the sd
            Powell made for the property of the said Ray. it Frequently hath happened that persons
            have concealed, or neglected to give in their property to the Commissn. for the purpose
            of 
            <span class="illegible">[bearing?]</span> legally Taxes, as also, property hath frequently been put out of the way, to prevent
            Distresses being made thereon &amp; thereby delay the Collection of Taxes &amp;c. and as Respects
            the intended Removall of the said negroes from Virga. to Maryland since 1784, the
            first &amp; all the Information I had (now recollected) was on or about the said 3d. day
            of July 1786.
