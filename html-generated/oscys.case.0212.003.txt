said Dells, as this defendant is informed &amp; believes to be true, resided before that time in Montgomery County. That this defendant from about the 10th of December 1802, until the 22d or 23d of August 1814, resided in the City of Washington in an official character, and he left his Home with the intention of <span class="gap ">[]</span> that character, to which he did <span class="gap ">[]</span>: That during that period part of his slaves as <span class="gap ">[]</span> House servants resided with him, and <span class="gap ">[]</span> as <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> backward &amp; forward from his residence in <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> farm; and at no other period did any <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> reside in the District.
