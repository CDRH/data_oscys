         <p>It will be perceived by the list and estimate appended to the report that the Slaves allotted to David Keen are valued at $2225 and that the other two lots amount to $2275 each. It results that each of the two last lots pays to the lot of David Keene $16 2/3 for equality of <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span>, thus making each division or third $2258 1/3 precisely</p>

         <p>The undersigned were requested to subdivide the third allotted to Mary Keens representatives and Fanny Simpsons representatives to receive then respective shares: this they have done as the statement will show, altho the terms of the order did not require it</p>

         <p>In making this subdivision, the undersigned allotted Francis Keen Winny John &amp; Henry. To Stacy Neals representatives Sam Letty and Harrison, and to Fanny Simpsons representatives Caroline Vincent and Rachel</p>
