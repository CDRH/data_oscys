         Case Narrative
         
         <p>Phylis Butler claimed she was "manumitted &amp; set free" by Philip Selby. The terms of
            her manumission, however, were complicated because Augustin Saira paid Selby for Butler's
            freedom. As a result Butler owed Saira. Under the terms of their arrangement, Butler
            argued, she could either pay Saira the equivalent money or work for him for a "certain
            length of time." Saira, however, used the opportunity to claim Butler as a slave,
            in effect taking the position that he purchased Butler rather than lent her fund in
            order to secure her freedom.
