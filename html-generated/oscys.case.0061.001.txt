         <p>To the Honorable Judges of the Circuit Court for Washington
County.</p>

      <div class="body ">

         <p>The petition of George Hunter, a person of color, humbly
sheweth to your Honors that you petitioner was introduced into the
State of Maryland from the State of
Virginia several years since by a certain William M.
Offutt, then being a citizen of the State of
Maryland: and that by the noncompliance of the said
Offutt with the requisitions of the Act of Assembly of
Maryland in which <span class="unclear illegible">[case?]</span> made and provided, your petitioner
has become intitled to his freedom. And your petitioner humbly sheweth that he
is credibly informed &amp; verily believes that the said
Offutt conspiring with one Zadock
Offutt (who likewise claims some interest in your petitioner) to
defraud him of his rights, designs to transfer him to some far distant state,
where, cut off from all means of establishing his <del>right</del> freedom, he
will be doomed to a hopeless slavery for life. <span class="unclear illegible">[To?]</span> avert which cruel fate, your petitioner humbly
prays the judgment of this Honorable Court that he be released from <span class="unclear illegible">[further?]</span> 
            <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span>.</p>

         <p>Clement Cox for the Petitioner</p>
