<p>Negro Ben v. Sabret Scott.</p>

</div>

<div class="syllabus ">

<p>Upon a petition for freedom the Court will not require the defendant to give security
for the wages of the petitioner during the litigation.</p>

</div>

<div class="body ">
 
<p>Ben had filed his petition for freedom, and a subpæna had issued
to the defendant to appear at next term, namely, December term,
1806. He now filed another petition, praying that the defendant
may be summoned before the Court to recognize not to carry the
petitioner away, &amp;c; whereupon the Court ordered a subpæna
returnable immediately, to answer to this petition; which the defendant
obeyed, and gave the recognizance.</p>

<p>Mr. F. S. Key for the petitioner, contended that the defendant
ought to recognize to pay such sum as the Court should adjudge
him to pay to the petitioner for his services from the time of exhibiting
the petition until judgment, in case the judgment should
be in favor of the petitioner.</p>

<p>But the Court refused; saying they had no jurisdiction in such
a summary way to give damages, and they could not compel the
defendant to assent to such a judgment.</p>
