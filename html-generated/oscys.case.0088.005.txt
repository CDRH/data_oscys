<p>Objected to, <del>awarded</del> refused &amp; exception taken</p>

<p>If the Jury believe from the said evidence that the said <del>the</del> Gerard Gibson made the Deed of Manumission offered in evidence while the claim of his wife for alimony was pending &amp; for the purpose of preventing her from recovering said claim, then such deed of manumission was fraudulent &amp; void, &amp; the Petrs are not entitled to their freedom under the said deed. But, that if the jury shall believe <del>that he conveyed them away</del> from the evidence that he made said deed with the view of preventing her from obtaining at his death a distributive portion of his said property, <del>he had a perfect right do to do and the deed is valid</del></p>
