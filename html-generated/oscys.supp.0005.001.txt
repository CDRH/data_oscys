         <p>A record of a recovery of freedom by the female ancestor of the petitioner, on the
            ground of her having been born free, may be given in evidence to support the petitioner's
            title, although the present defendant was not a party to that record; and the depositions
            of
            deceased witnesses, contained in that record, may be read as hearsay, to prove
            pedigree.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>A party producing a record in evidence is not obliged to read the whole of it; but
            the
            opposite party may read it.
         </p> 
         
         
         <p>Particular acts of turpitude cannot be given in evidence to discredit a witness. The
            question
            is only as to his general character for veracity. But see

         <p>Petition for freedom.</p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. E. J. Lee, for the petitioner, offered the record of
            a recovery in a suit for freedom by 
            <div class="bibl case">Rosamond
               Bentley v. A. Addison 
            </div>, which the Court (Cranch, C. J., absent,) admitted as evidence, to
            prove the freedom of Mary Davis, the ancestor of the present petitioner, and of
            the said Rosamond Bentley, who was the petitioner's aunt.

         <p>Mr. Lee, in support of his motion, contended that hearsay
            evidence would be admissible, and, if so, à
            fortiori a record which, although between other parties, goes to the
            same facts.

            <div class="bibl case">Pegram v. Isabell, 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 193. </div>
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court also suffered the depositions of witnesses,
            no dead, which had been taken in that suit and made part of that record, to be
            read in evidence as hearsay. The Court also suffered the defendant to read such
            parts only of a record which he produced as he thought proper, and said it was
            competent for the counsel of the petitioner to read the residue. The Court also
            admitted in evidence the record of a recovery by the petitioner's sister,
            Susan Davis, of her freedom, on the ground of having been
            freeborn.
