         <p>Richard Wallach makes oath and says that he, this deponent, filed a petition for freedom
            in the name and on the behalf of one Ami Gray in the Circuit Court of the District
            of Columbia for Washington County against one Henry Howison of the said County by
            whom the said Ami was held in bondage, 
            <span class="illegible">[returnable?]</span> to Novr Term 1834 That the said Howison was duly notified of the pendancy of the
            said  petition by being served with a subpoena in said case, as will appear by the
            
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> of the Marshal. That no appearance has yet been entered to the said case by the said
            Howison and this deponent is readily informed and believes that the said Howison after
            the service of the said subpoena did cause the said Ami to be 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> out of the District and beyond the jurisdiction of this cause, with intent and for
            the purpose of depriving the said Ami of the 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> of her said petition. And this deponent further says, that he 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> believes this deponent and said Howison 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> the said Howison that he this deponent had been so informed and that the said Howison
            did not deny it.
