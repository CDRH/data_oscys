<p>26th June 1810.</p>
                
<p>I do hereby certify, that I have known Susan the Petitioner
                    at least 36 years, during the whole of which time she has been in the
                    Neighbourhood of Bladensburgh, except the last twelve or
                    fifteen months she has lived in the City of Washington. I
                    have reason to believe and do firmly believe, that the Petitioner Susan
                        Boadley, her Parents and sister Dinah were
                    brought from Pennsylvania to
                        Maryland near 40 years ago, the property of Mr.
                        James Miller who bought them (as he informed me) in
                        Philadelphia. The first of my having any knowledge of
                        Susan was in the year '72 or '73
                    when she probably might have been about eight or nine years of age, and she then
                    waited on her Mistress Mrs. Miller in
                        Bladensburgh, and I often heard Mrs.
                        Miller call her, her favourite girl
                        Susan because (as Mrs. Miller
                    said) she was so remarkably black and smart. and Susan was
                    usually sent by her Mistress to tell Mr. Miller and the
                    young Gentlemen in his store to come to dinner. Shortly after Mrs.
                        Miller's death which happen'd some time in the year '74
                    or perhaps early in '75, Susan and the rest of Mr.
                        Miller's people he had in
                        Bladensburgh were remov'd to his Plantation about
                    four miles from Bladensburgh, where
                        Susan's father named Fortune, her
                    Mother named Phillis, her sister named
                        Dinah and her brother named Toney
                    then were. Susan remain'd at the Plantation some years;
                    afterwards, perhaps about the year '78 or'79 Mr. Miller
                    hired her to Miss Molley Tilley near
                        Bladensburgh where she continued several years. After
                        Susan left Miss Molley Tilley, she
                    liv'd near Bladenburgh 'till the last twelve or fifteen
                    months or thereabout, she has been hired in the City of
                        Washington.</p>

<p>Did you know or even hear of Captn James McCubbin. Answer -
                    Have heard of him but never knew him - nor what occupation he follow'd.</p>
                
<p>Did you ever hear where the Petitioner Susan, and her father 
                &amp; mother were landed <del>here</del> when they arrived here. Answer - I was informed that they were 
                landed at Queen-Ann, and then carried to Mrs. Pottinger's, where they remain'd until Mr. Miller married the daughter of Mrs. Pottinger late in the year 1771. And shortly after Mr. Miller's marriage, I was 
                credibly inform'd, that they were brough to Mr. Millers farm near 
                Bladenburgh, to wit Susan's father named 
                Fortune, her mother named Phillis and her sister 
                Dinah. Susan was kept in Bladensburgh 
                to wait upon her Mistress where she remain'd until the death of Mrs. Miller 
                in 1774, or 1775. After her Mistress' death she was remov'd from Bladenburgh 
                to her Masters farm.</p>
                
                <p>Had they any foreign dialect in their speech. Answer - Old Fortune and Phillis had a foreign dialect, but the Children had not. I know that Phillis had three children - 
                    Susan the Petitioner, Dinah who died a slave, 
                    and Toney <del>who</del> who belongs to Major Thomas Owen Williams, 
                    and is a slave. Toney, I have reason to believe, was about three or 
                    four years of age when he was brought here. Is Mr. Miller now living. Answer he is now living at Glasgow in Scotland, 
                    or was living when heard from lately, and left this Country in the year 1787. since when 
                    they have been the <del>sla</del> property and in the possession of Mrs. Ann Tilley 
                    Mr. Miller's daughter.</p>
                
<p>My knowledge of Susan the 
                    petitioner happen'd in this way. I was long and intimately acquainted with her Master Mr. Miller 
                    and frequently at his house when he liv'd in Bladenburgh. There I 
                    often saw Susan and noticed her Mistress, Mrs. Miller 
                    to be very fond of her. When Susan was at her Master's Plantation 
                    I frequently saw her there. and whilst she liv'd with Miss Molley Tilley, 
                    and since she left Miss Molly Tilley I often saw her and spoke to her. 
                    In short I have known Susan ever since the year '72 or '73. a period 
                    of about 37 years, during which time, to my certain knowledge, she has liv'd in this neighbourhood. 
                    When I first knew Susan, to wit in the year '72 or '73 she appear'd to 
                    be about 8 or 9 years of age. she now may be about 45 or 46 years old. perhaps something 
                    older or something younger.</p>
