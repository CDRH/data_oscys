<p>Dear sir</p>

<p>in the Case of Wm Crowner vs G Scott petition for freedom I served a notice on George Scott this day and he said he would attend to the matter and did not wish any of the papers left that he had heard of the rule before I called on him he was informed he said by Mr Arnold and that he would attend to it</p>

<p>Yours Jas Marshall</p>
