Imprimis I desire that my just debts shall be paid as soon after my decease as possible; and as it may be necessary to sell some part of my property for that purpose my will and desire is that my Executors hereafter named shall sell the land I purchase of Nicholas Lowe and also six lotts in the city of Washington which with the debts due to me will be more than sufficient to pay all just claims. Item I Give and Bequeath to Ann Carr my dear and affectionate wife (the best woman I ever knew or that I believe that ever lived) during her life all the rest and residue of my Estate both real and Personal. Item after the death of my beloved wife then my estate both real and Personal shall be equally divided between and among my four children towit, Eleanor Carr, Elizabeth Carr, Overton Carr and Jonathan Boucher Carr and their hairs. And whereas I have assigned to Samuel Carr (who married my Daughter Eleanor) and to persons for his use several Bonds to the amount of between four and five Thousand Dollars and whereas the Samuel Carr engaged with me to return and repay to me the amount of such Bonds so assigned; it is therefor my will and my request that Samuel Carr shall repay the amount of the Bonds aforesaid and that in such event my Daughter Eleanor or her heirs shall share equally with my other children in the division of my whole Estate, but it is hereby declared to be my will that if the amount of the assigned Bonds aforesaid is not paid then my Daughter Eleanor or her Heirs shall have no share or proportion of my Estate but the whole shall be divided between Elizabeth, Overton and Boucher. Item in the case of Samuel Carr paying the amount of the Bonds lent to him as aforesaid in cash it will be and I hereby will it to be in the discretion of my Executors what part of the Property I have appropriated shall be immediately sold for the payment of my debts. Item whereas I have at sundry times emancipated a number of negroes and in all cases may not have complied with strict legal form; in all such cases my will is that all and every negro so intended to be emancipated be me shall to all intents and purposes be free at the times
