         <p>Sir, Received your note in answer to mine of last Sunday <span class="unclear illegible">[sateing?]</span> your price of Abraham to be $500 and the <del>balance of the</del> 
            <span class="unclear illegible">[year?]</span> 
            <span class="unclear illegible">[hire?]</span>, Mr Lyons will give you a fair price for your man as he think he considers him not a prime hand, prime hand can be bought for $500 Abraham is small and weakly, he has Directed me to give you 400 <del>after</del> when the money paid the hire to stop by paying for what time he has served which I believe it is most he will give if you will take that sum you will write by Abraham so that I can make the arrangement with him for the money. Am yours most Respectfully</p>
