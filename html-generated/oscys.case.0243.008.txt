         <p>In this case the defendant having been summoned, and having failed to appear, an attachment
            was issued, by order of the Court at March Term, 1851; which has been returned 'non
            est', the defendant having  absconded or secreted herself to avoid the process of
            the Court. Nevertheless the defendant still detains the petitioner and holds her in
            slavery unlawfully in the district of Columbia &amp; within the jurisdiction of the Court.
            The counsel for the Petitioner therefore prays the Court to order the Marshall to
            take the body of the petitioner and have her before the Court without delay, to abide
            its further decision in the premises.
