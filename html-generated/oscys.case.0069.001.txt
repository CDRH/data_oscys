         <p>But that so far from this, he now claims to consider the advance or responsibility aforesaid as a bona fide purchase of your petitioner as a slave for life &amp; actually now claims her &amp; her infant child aforesaid, as slaves; Whereas your Petitioner concieves that she is, &amp; has been entitled to her freedom ever since the agreement aforesaid between her &amp; the said Lowe upon her completing the repayment of the recovery advanced by him. Your Petitioner therefore prays your Honors to decree her freedom &amp; that of her aforesaid Child &amp; as in duty bound will ever pray &amp; c</p>
