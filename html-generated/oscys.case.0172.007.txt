<p>If from the evidence aforesaid the Jury shall find that the said deed was executed acknowledged and delivered by the said Robert Armstead, and recorded as stated in said evidence the Jury will find of the Petitioner.</p>

<p>Unless:</p>

<p>They shall further find from the said evidence that at the time of the execution thereof the said Robert Armstead was by reason of <del>the</del> mental unsoundness incapable of understanding and acting in his own ordinary concerns in the ordinary affairs of life; and by reason of such unsoundness of mind incapable of understanding what he did, by Executing said deed, when its general import was <del>read or</del> explained to him</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>that the said deed was procured from him by undue influence amounting to fraud or forse and coercion destroying free agency, so that he was constrained to execute the same; but if the Jury shall find that the said deed was executed from the mere desire to gratify the wishes of another, that alone will not make it void and the "force and correction" above mentioned</p>

may be either moral or physical or both, either by force and coercion used upon the person of Armstead or upon his mind to such degree that his own free will was restrained <del>and</del> or constrained in the execution of the said deed.</p>

<p>--------o--------</p>

<p>If the Jury believes from the evidence that Robert Armstead was at any time prior to the execution of the said deed of manumission of unsound mind, and incapable of disposing of his property with understanding and reason, then the Law presumes he continued in such condition and the burden of proving that his mind was sound and he was capable of disposing of his property with understanding &amp; reason at the time of execution of the said deed is thereon upon the Petitioner and it will not do to prove merely that he was at that time capable of understanding and answering familiar and usual questions</p>

<p>But the Court do not thereby mean to say that the Petitioner is bound to introduce any new, further, or substantive <del>evidence</del> proof of these facts, and they leave the whole evidence aforesaid to the Jury from which they are to infer and find, shelter at the time of execution of the said deed he had the degree of capacity mentioned in the instructions given.</p>

<p>If the Jury believe from the evidence that Robert Armistead was a person of week and feeble mind and that the deed in question was executed by him at the Alms House away from and out of the presence of his friends and family &amp; without their knowledge, and that the execution of the same was procured by undue influence or fraud, then it is not his deed, and the petitioner is not entitled to recover</p>
