         <p>John Strother makes oath that he was informed by his counsel that this cause was not
            for trial at this term; and it is only within the last 24 hours that he was apprised
            of the attempt now made to call up the case for trial at this term; that he is wholly
            unprepared for trial; though there is evidence, at a great distance, and which he
            has a reasonable expectation of proving at the next term competent &amp; necessary for
            his defence in said suit; and without which he cannot try the same with Justice to
            his cause; in particular that one Eli Jacobs is a competent, material &amp; necessary
            witness on his behalf, without whose testimony he cannot go safely into the trial

            of the said suit and whose testimony is necessary to the Justice of the cause: that
            he expects to prove by sd witness that the petitioner was not imported into nor sold
            within this county, contrary to the act of assembly of Maryland, which was adopted
            by Congress as the law of this County; nor contrary to any other law; but that the
