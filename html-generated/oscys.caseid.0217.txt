         Case Narrative
         
         <p>Thomas Butler filed a petition for freedom against U.S. Supreme Court justice Gabriel
            Duvall on June 2, 1828 on behalf of himself and his wife, four children, and two grandchildren.
            The petitioners argued that they were "persons of colour who are entitled to their
            freedom." Members of the Butler family had won several cases in Maryland in the 1790s,
            although it is unclear if the plaintiffs in 1828 were related. Gabriel Duvall maintained
            that he was officially a resident of Prince George's County, Maryland, and therefore
            the plaintiffs sued in the wrong jurisdiction and the case in the D.C. court should
            be dismissed. Duvall's attempt to change the venue indicates that he probably expected
            a more favorable hearing in his home county. At trial the case turned on the complication
            of jurisdiction and the respective Maryland and Virginia acts regarding the sale and
            importation of slaves. The jury found for the petitioners in May 1831, and a motion
            for a new trail was overruled. Thomas and Sarah Butler, their four children, and two
            grandchildren, were free.

         Jury Instructions
         
         <p>The central claim of the Butlers centered on their residence three decades earlier
            when they were sold to Gabriel Duvall in May 1805. Jurisdictional boundaries and the
            acts on the sale and importation of slaves in D.C. were complex. Gabriel Duvall purchased
            the Butlers from a barkeeper in Georgetown named John Dales, who moved around Virginia
            and Maryland trying various pursuits. Dales hired out the Butlers to work in Maryland,
            Virginia, and D.C., and the Butlers gained independence and a degree of freedom even
            as their status remained unchanged. Because Dales may have sold the Butlers to Duvall
            in violation of the 
            <div class="bibl code">1796 Maryland Act </div>, an act that was in force in D.C., the jury had to determine when and under what
            circumstances the Butlers were sold to Duvall. As a result 
            <div class="bibl case">Butler, et al. v. Duvall </div> featured a series of conditional decisions for the jury. If the jury found that Dales
            moved from Virginia to Washington, D.C. with the Butlers held as slaves and then proceeded
            to sell them in D.C. within three years of their arrival, then they were imported
            for the purpose of selling them, a violation of the Maryland Act, and the Butlers
            were entitled to their freedom. If they were sold to Duvall while he was a resident
            of D.C. and while Dales lived as a resident in Virginia, they were imported illegally
            and entitled to their freedom.
