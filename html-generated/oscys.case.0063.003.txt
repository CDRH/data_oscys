         <p>It is admitted in this case that the Petr was a slave the property of Deft who is
            a lieutt in the U. S. Navy, &amp; ordered as such, to U. S. Ship Columbus. that there

            special application to take on board public vessels their personal servants the ships
            of war any others than free men that the Deft applied to Commodore Bainbridge the
            commanding officer of the Columbus for permission to have the Petr taken with him
            &amp; put on the muster roll of the Columbus, with a view to take him as a servant (each
            officer of his grade being allowed to take a man from the ship, company as a servant).
            That the com:g officer referred him to the Secy of the Navy; who again referred the
            request to the Com:g officer, who thereupon consented, 
            <del class="to his being">to his being</del>and he was accordingly received on board and enrolled as a supernumerary in said ship
            to receive provisions only. Whereupon the said Petitioner sometime in the year 1819
            or 1820 was accordingly so enrolled previous to the sailing of the Columbus &amp; sailed
            in the said refusal to foreign pacts beyond the U. State

         <p>that afterwards on or about the 
            <span class="illegible">[?]</span> 1821 the said Deft was ordered from the said ship Columbus to the U. S. Brig of war
            Spark also under command of Commadore Bainbridge 
            <del class="and">and</del> took the Petr with him on board said Ship where he was enrolled on the Books of said

         <p>It is also admitted that after Petitioner had received his pay, he delivered it over

         <p>Upon the above statement it is submitted to the Court to determine whether the entering
            &amp; enrolling the Petr as above stated &amp; his serving as aforesaid with the knowledge
            &amp; consent of the Deft, amounts to an implied manumission of Petr.
