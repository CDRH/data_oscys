            Circuit Court which were brought into the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue
            of a writ of error agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided

            that such further proceedings be had in the said cause as according to right and justice
            and the laws of the United States and agreeably to the said judgment and directions
