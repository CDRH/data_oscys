<p>Negro Walter Thomas v. Alexander Scott</p>

</div>

<div class="syllabus ">

<p>Upon a petition for freedom, the defendant may appear and disclaim, without entering into the usual recognizance.</p>

</div>

<div class="body ">
 
<p>Petition for freedom. The defendant, Scott, offered to appear and disclaim all right of property in the petitioner, at the time of service of the subpœna or any time since.</p>
                
<p>Mr. Law, for the petitioner, objected that he must enter into a
recognizance before he can appear, and prayed for an attachment
for not obeying the summons. The <span class="bibl code">Act of Assembly 1796, c. 43,
§ 5</span>, authorizes the Court to require such a recognizance. Mr.
Law suggested that Mr. Scott, knowing that a petition was filed,
sold and conveyed away the negro before service of the subpœna.</p>
                
<p>The Court said that a man may appear, to disclaim, without
entering into the recognizance to have the negro forthcoming, and
refused the attachment.</p>
