         <p>3. Mr. Johnson - was one of the overseers of the Poor of Fairfax County, and in the year 1819 or 1820, Wesley Adams applied to the overseers of the Poor of said County, for money, to support &amp; maintain, two of the young children of Sarah, and subsequently he applied in like manner, for the support of three of Sarah's young children - but does not know, that the Petitioner was one of the children aforesaid.
