         <p>If the Jury believe from the evidence that Robert Armistead was at any time, prior
            to the execution of the said deed of manumission of unsound mind, and incapable of
            disposing of his property with understanding &amp; reason, then the Law presumes he continued
            in such condition, and the burthen of proving that his mind was sound &amp; he capable
            of disposing of his property with understanding &amp; reason at the time of the execution
            of the said deed is thrown upon the Petitioner and it will not do to prove merely
            that he was at that time capable of understanding &amp; answering

            any new, further, or substantive proof of these facts, and they learn the whole evidence
            aforesaid to the Jury from which they are to infer and find whether at the time of
            the execution of the said deed he had that degree of capacity mentioned in the instructions
            given,
