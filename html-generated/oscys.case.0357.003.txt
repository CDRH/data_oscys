         <p>Ann Kintcheloe appears as defendant</p>

         <p>The Petition of Negro Daniel shews to your honors that he is a Petitioner for his freedom against a certain       Ballard as appears by the certificate herewith exhibited. Your Petitioner shews, that he is now forcibly held by       Legge &amp; others who are now about to carry him away from this District &amp; to prevent him from having a trial. Your Petitioner states &amp; can prove that the said     Legge &amp; others are now in the act of tying him &amp; <span class="unclear illegible">taking[?]</span> him off by free.     Legge &amp; others are negro buyers. Your Petitioner therefor prays an injunction to issue to said Legge &amp; others prohibiting them from taking your Petitioner from this county with proper security to guarantee their compliance.</p>
