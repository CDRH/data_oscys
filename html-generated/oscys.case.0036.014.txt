         <p>It is admitted in this case that John Thompson of
St. Mary's County owned these negroes as slaves for life.
That the said John Thompson died possessed of them in the
year 1804 and that he made his last Will &amp; testament disposing of these
among others as appears by a copy thereof herewith exhibited &amp; filed in this
cause. It is also admitted that Elizabeth Thompson the wife
of the testator John Thompson had no child within nine
months after his death nor at any time before. That the said
Elizabeth refused to abide by the Will of the said
testator and that she renounced her claim under the Will as appeared
<del>a</del> by an Exht in the case. That the said renunciation was made
according to law &amp; within the time required. That in the course of
distribution of the testators <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> 
            <del>was mad in the year 1810 the death of</del> the

         <p>The said petitioners Joseph &amp; Nelly
who upon the death of the said Elizabeth were returned by
the administrators of said Elizabeth Thompson, in the
inventory &amp; appraisement of the estate, as slaves for life, and so
distrubuted among her representatives: it is agreed that the inventory &amp;
appraisement of the estate of the said John Thompson, with
the accounts settled by <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> 
with the orphan's court, all herewith exhibited,
contain a true &amp; full statement of the personal estate left by the testator,
and of his debts, legacies, <span class="unclear illegible">[funeral?]</span>

&amp;c.</p>

         <p>(a)</p>

         <p>Upon these facts
it is admitted to the Court for their Judgment whether or not the widow in her
legal renunciation had the power to insist on taking these negroes
Joseph &amp; Nelly as slaves for life or whether or not the
surviving executor could assign these negroes to the said <del>representatives of</del>
Elizabeth Thompson as slaves for life. <del>And whether or
not Sarah Anne who was born the time
Nelly had to serve by the Will is a slave for life.</del>

distributive share in the slaves left by the said testator, notwithstanding the
said devices of freedom to such slaves as expressed in said Will, and to hold
such distributive share as slaves for life, that the slaves so received by her
of the executor of the said testator, did not exceed her just slave &amp;
proportion of such slaves.</p>
