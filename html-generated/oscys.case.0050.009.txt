         <p>Mr Hay.</p>

         <p>Reasons in arrent of Judgmt as to the Petitioner. radically &amp; essentially defective. "That William is a free man Held in Bondage by a certain Lemuel Sawyer &amp;c</p>

         <p>This allegation not sufficient. too <del>gen</del> general. this case like all others, requiring pleadings &amp;c</p>

         <p>ought to state in what way he claims his freedom, whether born free, or by importation or otherwise...</p>

         <p>So in the cause of this trail alltho the Pet. Counsel calld on to state the specific ground <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> with his writ. refusd to give him the information.</p>

         <p>
            <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> did know untill the Pet counsel had closd his remarks on the subject what grounds upon which he claimd his freedom</p>

         <p>
            <span class="unclear illegible">[can?]</span> in a Court of Equity <span class="unclear illegible">[move?]</span> 
            <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> would be required. allegation must embrace the whole matter with <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> act of assembly on the subject. 22nd Sec.</p>

         <p>to determine each and all of the allegations in the said Petition</p>

         <p>the words "allegation" furnishes inference that the allegations that he is free only not enough</p>

         <p>Mr Key. the objection <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> too late he ought to have made the objection at the time of the plea</p>

         <p>issue is simply whether the man is free or not</p>

         <p>Mr Hay in conclusion.<br/>
as to the <span class="unclear illegible">[practice?]</span> of the <span class="unclear illegible">[facts?]</span> were if in <span class="unclear illegible">[evidence?]</span> does not warrant the proceeding in this case</p>

         <p>not aware that the court has ever decided the point</p>

         <p>as to being too late<br/>
proves too much. that no motion in arrant of Judg. could be made in any case</p>
