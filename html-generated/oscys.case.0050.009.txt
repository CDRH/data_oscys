         <p>Reasons in arrent of Judgmt as to the Petitioner. radically &amp; essentially defective.
            "That William is a free man Held in Bondage by a certain Lemuel Sawyer &amp;c
         </p>
         
         
         <p>This allegation not sufficient. too

         </p>
         
         
         <p>ought to state in what way he claims his freedom, whether born free, or by importation
            or otherwise...
         </p>
         
         
         <p>So in the cause of this trail alltho the Pet. Counsel calld on to state the specific
            ground 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> with his writ. refusd to give him the information.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> did know untill the Pet counsel had closd his remarks on the subject what grounds
            upon which he claimd his freedom
         </p>
         
         
         <p>

         <p>to determine each and all of the allegations in the said Petition</p>
         
         
         <p>the words "allegation" furnishes inference that the allegations that he is free only
            not enough
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr Key. the objection 
            <span class="torn page">[torn page]</span> too late he ought to have made the objection at the time of the plea
         </p>
         
         
         <p>issue is simply whether the man is free or not</p>
         
         
         <p>Mr Hay in conclusion.
            <br></br>
            as to the 
            <span class="illegible">[practice?]</span> of the 
            <span class="illegible">[facts?]</span> were if in 
            <span class="illegible">[evidence?]</span> does not warrant the proceeding in this case
         </p>
         
         
         <p>not aware that the court has ever decided the point</p>
         
         
         <p>as to being too late
            <br></br>
            proves too much. that no motion in arrant of Judg. could be made in any case
