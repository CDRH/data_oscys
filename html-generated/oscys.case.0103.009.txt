         <p>Personally appears Henry Howison who being duly sworn deposes and says in answer to
            the notice to show cause in the case of Amy Gray why an attachment should not issue
            against him that he had no intention whatever of committing any contempt against the
            Court on not having appeared to the summons. That on the contrary Soon after the precept
            was served upon him he spoke to James Hoban Esqr an attorney of this Court to enter
            his appearance for the deponent and to defend or attend to the case. That he supposed
            an appearance had been entered to him until recently when he understood it had been
            forgotten. That before the notice to show cause had been served upon him he had employed
            another attorney to unite with Mr Hoban in looking after this matter but that he is
            informed the Motion for the rule to show cause against an attachment was made in the
            early part of the first day of this term and before the regular proceedings upon the
            civil docket had commenced so that his Counsel had not had time to look at the case.
            That he denies having removed the petitioner Amy Gray after the Summons was served
            upon him though he believes he informed the man that such a 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> had 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> as he though he was in duty bound to do. That he also disclaims any ownership in
            or to the said negro and begs leave to state his agency in the matter. The said negro
            was hired by him from a person in Virginia and as he had some how heard that it was
            necessary to have some evidence of ownership to present a claim for freedom he took
            a Bill of Sale for her which he had recorded and gave an obligation in writing to
            return the said negro to the owner upon demand agreeing at the same time to pay a
            hire for her services of Twenty dollars per anum. 
            <del class="That when the petition of freedom was known to him it was">That when the petition of freedom was known to him it was</del> That near a year before this petition he had found that the negro would not suit
            him and he had notified the owner Mrs Mary Ann Potts of the fact who had 
            <del class="taken her out of the custody of this affiant and">taken her out of the custody of this affiant and</del> sent a person to this City to hire her out and as he did not succeed the deponent
            was requested to act as an agent for that purpose and hired her to one John Coburn
            since which time the deponent has had nothing to do with the negro. That the said
            negro was not in his service, possession, or in any way under his control at the time
            of the service of the summons and had not been for near a year before that period.

            </span>
            
            That he understands and believes that the said negro woman is now in Alexandria in
            the District of Columbia and that this deponant so far from endeavouring in any way
            to put or 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> her and of the reach of the jurisdiction or action of this Court has really advised
            and notified the person 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> Thomas who is acting as agent for the owner that there is a petition for her freedom
            pending in the Court and that she ought not to be carried away.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>That this affiant claims nothing in said negro &amp; would not give five dollars to own
            her.
