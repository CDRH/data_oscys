         <p>Statement of Facts submitted to the Court upon which their judgment is prayed.</p>
         
         
         <p>It is agreed in this case that the Petitioner Robert Henly was removed by his owner
            
            Bennett Jarboe from the City of Washington (being   
            a Maryland born Slave) to Alexandria in the 
            County of Alexa Dist of Cola in the year 1801. That 
            the said Bennett Jarboe continued to reside in Alexa 
            with the Petitioner for a period of Seven or Eight years. That no record Entry nor
            oath as 
            required by an Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia entitled "an Act to 
            reduce into One the several acts concerning Slaves, Free negroes &amp; mulattoes" passed
            the 
            17th December 1792 was at any time taken or made by the said Bennett Jarboe. 
            That the claim to the said Petitioner is 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> 
            by Bill of sale of one Andrew Way Jr. by whom the said Slave was purchased from the
            said 
            Jarboe.
