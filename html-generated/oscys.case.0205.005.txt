<p>Whereupon the Dft by his council prayed the Court to instruct the Jury that if they should believe from the evidence aforesaid (viz. the Evidence stated in the first bill of exceptions) that Mrs Wallingsford held the petitioners by virtue of an agreement made between her &amp; her husband, without the intervention of a trustee, that said agreement in null &amp; void &amp; could give no power to Mrs Wallingsford to manumit the slaves held by virtue of such an agreement.</p>

Nor can he be deprived of any of his rights by virtue of said agreement.

<p>The Dft, then, prayed the Court to instruct the Jury that if they should believe from the evidence aforesaid that the petitioners or any of them, at the time of the execution of the deed of manumission aforesaid were not able to by their labor to procure for themselves sufficient food or raiment with other necessary requisites of life, then the said deed of manumission, as to them, or such of them was inoperative. Which instruction the Court gave; and also at the prayer of the counsel for the petitioners, further instructed the Jury. That if they should believe from the said Evidence that the said children in the said deed mentioned were of healthy constitutions and sound in mind and body, and that their mother was capable by labor to procure to them sufficient food and raiment with other requisite necessaries of life, and did maintain them, then such children are not under the incapacity intended by the Maryland law.</p>
