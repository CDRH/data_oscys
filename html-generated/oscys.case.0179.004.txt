         <p>The Petition of Richard B. Alexander humbly represents that at March Term 1840 of
            the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Washington, on a petition
            for freedom filed by Moses Graham against the said Richard B. Alexander, complaining
            of illegal detention in slavery, judgment was rendered for the said Richard B. Alexander,
            but not as fully and complete a judgment as ought in law have been rendered in the
            care, as will more fully appear by a copy of the record and proceedings in the said
            cause and hereto annexed.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>And the said Richard B. Alexander assigns error as follows:</p>
         
         
         <p>The first fact the Jury find in the special verdict (bearing on the point in error)
            is, "that Miss Brown sold Milly and her two children to Mrs Alexander she to be free
            at 31 and her children then born and then afterwards to be born at the same age" They
            further find that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of each negroes
            to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age" Upon a reference, however, to
            the will of Miss Brown (in the transcript of the proceedings) it will be found that
            the petitioner (Moses Graham) is not mentioned or referred to, is not emancipated
            by any possibility of construction which the court could 
            <del class="with any pretense of reason in">with any pretense of reason in</del> by law, give to the instrument.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Now the error assigned by the defendant
            
            
            <span class="hr"> </span>
            <span class="pageimage">

               </a>
            </span>
            
            is, in the erroneous 
            <del class="and most unreasonable">and most unreasonable</del> application of the law to the above facts. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
            <div class="bibl citation">The law of Virginia 1792 Chap. 103 section 36 </div> (and applicable to this case) provides that slaves shall be emancipated either by
            last will and testament or by deed recorded in the county or corporation court. Any
            other method of emancipation is void.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>As such is the law, the fact found by the Jury that "Milly" (mother of the Petitioner)
            "and her children were sold to Mrs Alexander to be free as they should respectively
            arrive at the age of 31 years" does not amount to such an emancipation as the law
            requires.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The fact found by the Jury that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale
            of such negroes to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age" is an encroachment
            on the province of the Court, whose duty it is to decide as to the import and construction
            of last wills and testaments. It will be found upon a reference to this will that
            the Petitioner (Moses) is not mentioned in such will, is not referred to by the testatrix,
            that there is not the remotest implication by which his freedom can be effected
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Notwithstanding the said will does not emancipate the Petitioner, and although the
            law 
            <span class="illegible">[peremptorily?]</span> requires the emancipation to be by deed or last will and testament, the Court, 
            <del class="in total disregard of said law">in total disregard of said law</del> gives to the petitioner his freedom at the age of 31 years.
         </p>

         <p>The error above assigned involves a question of law of extensive interest, both public
            and private, of a public interest, since it admits the reception of parol evidence
            to explain and enlarge the meaning of a will, to give to a last will and testament
            a different meaning from that which the words in themselves evidently and necessarily
            imply; of a private interest to the defendant, since there are several other slaves,
            having similar claims, in whose favour similar verdicts would be found, and which
            verdicts would be construed by the Court, as having a similar legal effect and operation,
            unless the Supreme Court shall reverse so 
            <del class="monstrous">monstrous</del> erroneous a decision.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that your Honor will issue an order to the Clerk of
            the said Court directing him to issue a writ of error under the terms and conditions
            prescribed by law in all such cases, and as in duty bound he will ever pray.
