<div class="syllabus ">

<p>Upon a petition for freedom by slaves entitled to emancipation
at a future day, the Court refused to instruct the jury, that they might find
their verdict for the petitioners, although that day had not yet arrived; and
upon a special verdict showing their

right to emancipation at a future day, not
yet come, the Court rendered judgment for the defendant; and refused, as a court
of equity, to continue an injunction which had been served upon the marshal to
prevent him from delivering the petitioners to the defendant at law, during the
pendency of their suit for freedom; being of opinion that the only ground of the
right of the Court to interfere was the petitioner's claim to immediate freedom; and
the pendency of their suit at law.</p>

<p>That the fears alone of the petitioners, that the defendant, who
was a citizen of Maryland, would violate the laws of that
State, were not a sufficient ground of jurisdiction to require of him security
that he would not do so.</p>

<p>Petition for freedom by Lizette, John, and Janette, or Jeane, children of Joanna, and Nancy, the daughter of Lizette.</p>

<p>The petitioners having given evidence tending to prove their right to
emancipation after certain periods of service respectively which had not yet
expired, prayed the Court by their counsel, Mr. Barrell,
to instruct the jury, in effect,that they might find the issue for the
petitioners, although their respective terms of servitude, according to their
deed of emancipation, had not expired; which instruction the Court (Thruston, J. contrà) refused to give.</p>

<p>The jury found a special verdict, which stated,</p>

<p>1. "That the negro girl Joan or Joanna,
on the 23th of June 1797, was the property of
Anthony Addison, then a citizen of
Maryland, residing in Prince George's
county, in that State, where he held her as a slave for life.</p>

<p>2. That on that day he sold her to Walter Addison, also a
citizen of Maryland and residing in the said county, for
a term of twelve years, by a bill of sale in writing, in
hœc verba, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. That after the said Walter Addison had held her about
eighteen months under the said bill of sale he exchanged her unexpired term with
on Peter Savary, then a citizen of
Maryland, and residing in the same county, for a like
term in another negro woman, the latter to be returned to Savary at the
expiration of the said term. And we find that at the time of this exchange there
was a stipulation and an understanding between the parties principals, that the
children of the said Joanna, born or to be born, were to be
free after having served, men children until they attained the age of thirty or
thirty-one years, and female children when they should attain the age of
twenty-five years respectively; and that the said Joanna
was then delivered, and held in the said State and county, until the expiration
of the said term; and that afterwards she was returned and given up to the said
Anthony Addison.</p>

<p>4. That three of the petitioners, to wit, John,
Lizette, and Janette or
Jeane, are children of the said
Johanna, born during the said term of twelve years; and the
petitioner Nancy is the child of the petitioner
Lizette, and was born long after the ex-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.report.0019.001.003.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.report.0019.001.003.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.report.0019.001.003.jpg" class="display"/></a></span>

piration of the said
term, to wit, in the year 1825, or thereabout; the mother still be held by the
said Savary.</p>

<p>5. That the said Savary did not deliver up the said
petitioners to the said Anthony Addison; and that upon the
death of the said Savary, they came to the possession of
the defendant as administrator of Savary.</p>

<p>6. That after the expiration of the said term, to wit, on the 8th of October, 1809, the said Anthony
Addison executed in the said State of
Maryland, and acknowledged an instrument of writing,
purporting to be an emancipation of the said Joan or
Joanna, and her children; among others, of the three first
above-named petitioners, after certain terms of service expressed, or reserved
in the said writing, which, with the acknowledgment and memorial of the record
thereof, we find, in these words, &amp;c.</p> 

<p>7. We find that the terms of service, which the said instrument purports to have
reserved and annexed to the emancipation of the said petitioners respectively,
will expire at the times following, to wit, of the said
John in May, 1830; of Lizette at
Christmas, 1827; of the said Janette or
Jeane, on the 19th of May, 1834; and the petitioner
Nancy is about two years old.</p>

<p>"If upon the facts so found," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Court, upon the facts so found, was of opinion,
(nem. con.) that the petitioners will be entitled to
their freedom, at the expiration of their respective terms of servitude
agreeably to the deed of emancipation from Anthony
Addison.</p>

<p>"But a majority of the judges are of the opinion that as none of those terms of
servitude have yet expired, the judgment upon the special verdict must be for the
defendant; who being now fully apprised of the petitioners' contingent right to
freedom, will take care that he do not subject himself to the penalty of the law
of Maryland by selling them out of the State for a longer
time than they have to serve by law."</p>

<p>Thruston, J., doubted upon the last point; and was
understood to be of opinion that the issue, submitted to the jury, was whether
the petitioners were the slaves of the defendant; and that as they had a right
to emancipation at a future day they could not now be slaves.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrell, then, as solicitor for the petitioners,
filed a bill for injunction in each case, stating their contingent right to
freedom, and their fears that the defendant would sell them to persons who would
carry them to some distant place, where they would not be able to prove and
maintain their right to freedom.</p>

<p>The petitioners had run away from the defendant, believing themselves entitled to
freedom, and had been taken up and committed to jail here where they petitioned
for their freedom. The

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.report.0019.001.004.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.report.0019.001.004.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.report.0019.001.004.jpg" class="display"/></a></span>

Court had ordered the marshal not to deliver them up to the defendant unless upon
his entering into the usual recognizance, or until the further order of the
Court. The bills, now filed, prayed that the injunction on the marshal should be
continued until the defendant should give security not to sell the petitioners
out of the State of Maryland, nor for a longer term that
they have to serve.</p>

<p>The Court, however, (Thruston, J. contrà,) refused to continue the injunction after the
judgement at law in favor of the defendant, being of opinion that the only
ground of their right to interfere was the petitioners' claim to immediate
freedom, and the pendency of their suit in this Court; that their suit being now
ended and judgment against them, although they may be hereafter entitled to
freedom, the Court think they cannot require security
from the master that he will not violate the laws of
Maryland; the fears alone of these petitioners, would not
give this Court jurisdiction. No final relief could be given. Nothing is asked
for by the bill, and nothing could be given, but security that the master, in
exercising his acknowledged rights, would not violate the law of
Maryland, the place of his residence. It is possible that
the Courts of Maryland might be of a different opinion as
to the rights of the petitioners, and we might bind the defendant not to do,
what they might determine he might lawfully do.</p>

<p>Injunction refused.</p>
