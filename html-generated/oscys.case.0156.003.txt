            <del class="the">the</del> Orvin Davis comes into Court here in his own proper person and prays judgment of
            the Court upon the said write issued in this cause because he says that the said writ
            was served upon this defendant whose name is Orvin and not Irvine, and that he supposes
            the same was intended for to mean this deponent although he was baptized by the name
            of Orvin and not Irvine (to wit 
            <del class="at the County of Washington in the District of Columbia">at the County of Washington in the District of Columbia</del>( and by that name is called and known, and by the same name from the time of his
            baptism hitherto both been named and called: without this that he the said Orvin Davis
            now is or ever was called or known by the name of Irvine Davis as by the said write
            is above supposed. And this he is ready to verify wherefore he saith that the said
            Court here ought not to take nor will take cognizance of the said plea against him
            in this Court.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Orvin Davis being duly sworn deposes and says that the facts in the foregoing plea
            set forth and contained are true as therein set forth
