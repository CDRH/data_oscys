Henry Pile in Charles County Court, the object of which was to procure her Freedom, her son Robert Thomas having before that period sued for, and obtained his freedom, by a judgment of the General Court, that besides Mr. Pile, Miss <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> Stone, Mr. William D.

of the same family, that is, of the Thomass', who also claimed their freedom, some of whom applied to me to file Petitions for them, which I declined doing, untill Judy's <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> should be disposed of. That when the petition agt. Mr. Pile was filed it was understood between him and myself, that if she got free, all the rest of her family should be liberated without any further litigation, and I think it

probable, but of this I was not certain, that Mr. Scott under a similar arrangement with me. It was my Habit to sue for one or two only if a family, <span class="unclear illegible">[during?]</span> claims to freedom, under a <span class="unclear illegible">[Hope?]</span> in some Instances, and in others positive stipulations that if they suceeded the rest of the family would be discharged.</p>
