            the part of the Defendant.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To the 3d Interrogatory. This deponent answereth and saith, That the said Petitioner
            was taken by him from Maryland to the State of Virginia in May 1834. The circumstances
            attending his going to Virginia with this deponent are these. The deponent a few days
            before he left the State of Maryland, was unfortunately engaged in a fracas, in which
            the Petitioner was with him as a body servant. The consequences of which fracas compelled
            him, this deponent, to leave the state, and the said Petitioner being afraid to remain
            in the State without this deponent, begged to accompany him to the State of Virginia
            which he did contrary to the will and wishes of his mistress

            This deponent further saith, that with regard to the trip of the Petitioner to the
            City of Washington, he accidentally omitted an answer to the third Interrogatory but
            answered the third cross Interrogatory with regard to the same. This deponent further
            saith that in going to the State of Virginia, circumstances compelled him, and it
            was his determination to return to the state of Maryland when he could do so with
            safety. And also that it was against the will and wishes of Petitioner's Mistress
            Miss Purnell. That he (the deponent) take him (the Petitioner) to the state of Virginia,
            and that I retained him with me. This deponent further saith that he (the deponent)
            believes that it was some time in the fall or winter of 1836, that he (the deponent)
            gave a written permission to the Petitioner to hire himself in the District of Columbia,
            contrary to the expressed will and wishes of Miss Purnell, and that the Petitioner
            has remained in Washington, to the best of his knowledge, until the preset time.

         <p>This deponent further saith that Miss Purnell, the mistress of the Petitioner did
            object to his remaining with the deponent in Virginia, but that the deponent kept
            him, fearing the consequences of sending the Petitioner back to the E. Shore, without
            the Petitioner he was with the deponent, furthermore this deponent saith not.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To the third additional Cross Interrogatory for the Petitioner</p>
         
         
         <p>To the 3d Interrogatory. This deponent answereth and saith, that to the 3d Cross Interrogatory,
            he refers to the 3d Interrogatory for an explanation of the first clause of the 3d
            Cross Interrogatory. And this deponent further saith that Miss Purnell did not give
            the Petitioner to this deponent (absolutely,) or conditionally. The word (absolutely,)
            being used by this deponent in his former deposition, as merely responsive to the
            language of the Interrogatory &amp; further this deponent saith not.
