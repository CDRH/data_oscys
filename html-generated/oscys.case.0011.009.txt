<p>On the trial of this Cause the Counsel for the Petitioners having read in
Evidence the following Depositions (Here insert them) And the Counsel for the
Defendant having also read in Evidence the following Depositions (here insert them) 
<del class="&amp; the former instructions of the Court (here insert 1. &amp; 2.)&#xA;having been admitted by the Petitioners Counsel, Defendants Counsel prayed&#xA;the Court to instruct the Jury that if they should believe from the Evidence&#xA;aforesaid that the Existence of such a noise and report in the neighbourhood&#xA;respecting the Circumstances of the said Mary&#xA;Queen's importation as is stated in&#xA;Disneys Deposition produced &amp; read as Evidence on&#xA;the part of the Petitioners were not stated from the knowledge of the said&#xA;Disney but what had been communicated to him respecting&#xA;the Existence of such a report and noise, many years after the importation of the said&#xA;Mary Queen without its appearing from whom or in what&#xA;manner the same had been communicated to him, then the said Evidence of the&#xA;said Disney is incompetent to prove either the&#xA;Existence of such a Report &amp; Noise, or the truth of them. And if&#xA;the Jury should believe from the Evidence that the Declaration of Captain&#xA;John Jims as stated in Warfields&#xA;Deposition also produced &amp; read as Evidence by the Petitioner were not&#xA;derived from&#xA;his Jim's own knowledge but were founded on hearsay or report communicated&#xA;to him many years after said importation and Sale of the said Mary&#xA;Queen without its appearing by whom or in what manner such&#xA;communication was made to him then his said Declarations are not competent&#xA;Evidence in this Cause which Instructions the Court gave as prayed, to which&#xA;opinion and Instruction the Petitioners by his Counsel excepts&#xA;and prays that this their Bill may be signed sealed &amp; enrolled which is&#xA;accordingly done.">&amp; the former instructions of the Court (here insert 1. &amp; 2.)
having been admitted by the Petitioners Counsel, Defendants Counsel prayed
the Court to instruct the Jury that if they should believe from the Evidence
aforesaid that the Existence of such a noise and report in the neighbourhood
respecting the Circumstances of the said Mary
Queen's importation as is stated in
Disneys Deposition produced &amp; read as Evidence on
the part of the Petitioners were not stated from the knowledge of the said
Disney but what had been communicated to him respecting
the Existence of such a report and noise, many years after the importation of the said
Mary Queen without its appearing from whom or in what
manner the same had been communicated to him, then the said Evidence of the
said Disney is incompetent to prove either the
Existence of such a Report &amp; Noise, or the truth of them. And if
the Jury should believe from the Evidence that the Declaration of Captain
John Jims as stated in Warfields
Deposition also produced &amp; read as Evidence by the Petitioner were not
derived from
his Jim's own knowledge but were founded on hearsay or report communicated
to him many years after said importation and Sale of the said Mary
Queen without its appearing by whom or in what manner such
communication was made to him then his said Declarations are not competent
Evidence in this Cause which Instructions the Court gave as prayed, to which
opinion and Instruction the Petitioners by his Counsel excepts
and prays that this their Bill may be signed sealed &amp; enrolled which is
accordingly done.</del></p>

<p>And the Petitioners further offered evidence to prove that they are
lineally descended from the Mary Queen in the said
Depositions mentioned, who is claimed to have been the great grandmother of the
Petitioner Mima;</p>

<p>Whereupon the <del class="the">the</del> Deft's Counsel prayed the court to instruct the Jury
as follows;</p>

<p>Instructions &amp; opinions of the Court as prayed by the Deft.</p>

<p>1. That the Petitioners must be presumed to be legally held in bondage
untill competent proof is produced of their being entitled to freedom; and the
burthen of proving the same is on the Petitioners. (admitted by the Petitioner's
Counsel)</p>

<p>2. That Mary Queen, the great grandmother
of the Petitioners, from whom they claim descent in the lineal female line, if
found by the Jury to have been of a yellow or Tawney colour and to have been
held &amp; treated as a slave from the time of her importation &amp; sale till
her death, must be presumed to have been imported as a slave &amp; to have been
rightfully held &amp; treated as such, untill the contrary is proved by the
Petitioners. (admitted by the Petitioner's Counsel)</p>

<p>3d. If the Jury find from the evidence that the existence of such a report &amp; noise in the
neighborhood, respecting the circumstances of the said Mary
Queen's importation, as is stated in
Disney's deposition produced &amp; read as evidence on the
part of the Petrs, was not stated from the knowledge of the
witness, but from what had been communicated to him, respecting the
existence of such a report &amp; noise, many years after her importation without
its appearing by whom or in what manner the same was communicated to him; then
the said evidence of the said Disney is <del class="not">not</del> incompetent to
prove either the existence of such a reporte &amp; noise <del class="at the time of&#xA;such importation">at the time of
such importation</del> or the truth of it; and if the Jury find from
the evidence that the declarations of Capt John Jims, as
stated in Warfield's deposition also produced &amp; read as
evidence on the part of the Petitrs, were not derived from his
(Jims's) own knowledge, but were founded upon hearsay or
report, communicated to him many years after the said importation &amp; sale of
the said Mary Queen without its appearing by whom or in
what manner such communication was made to him; then his said declarations are
not competent evidence <del class="to which">to which</del> in this cause. <del class="(granted&#xA;by the Court &amp; excepted to by Petitioners) to be preceeded by the same&#xA;statement as the last excn">(granted
