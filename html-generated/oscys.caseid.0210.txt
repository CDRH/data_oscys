         Case Narrative
         
         
         <p>Sarah Ann Allen petitioned for her freedom on behalf of her three children and herself
            against Joseph Wallingsford. Rachel Wallingsford filed for divorce from Joseph Wallingsford.
            Before the divorce had been finalized, Joseph agreed to send Sarah Ann Allen to Rachel.
            Rachel manumitted the Sarah Ann Allen and for some period of time Allen lived in freedom
            independently of Rachel Wallingsford. Sarah Ann Allen had three children during this
            time. But after Rachel died, Joseph Wallingsford claimed both Sarah Ann Allen and
            her children as his slaves, arguing that their deed of manumission was invalid and
            that they remained his property. Wallingsford contended that women could not accept
            property independently and that Rachel executed the deed of manumission before the
            divorce was finalized. The court allowed the deed of manumission to be admitted into
            evidence, however, and the jury found for the petitioners. The defendant slaveholder
            Joseph Wallingsford appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. He argued that several
            instructions to the jury should have been allowed indicating that without the intervention
            of a trustee the agreement to give Sarah Ann Allen to Rachel as property in alimony
            was void. He also argued that under Maryland law slaves who would become a burden
            to society could not be manumitted, and that the Allen infants fit this barred category.
            The U.S. Supreme Court upheld and affirmed the lower court judgment. The Allens were
            free. The court concluded in its majority opinion: "It would be an unreasonable restraint
            upon the privileges of manumission, as it is granted in this act, if it were interpreted
            to exclude the manumission of mother and an infant child, the former being of healthy
            constitution and able to maintain it."

         Women's Property
         
         <p>Much of this case turned on Joseph Wallingsford's claim that Rachel Wallingsford could
            not have manumitted Sarah Ann Allen because as a married woman she was unable to hold
            and convey property without his consent. The Supreme Court held that under equity
            law there were numerous exceptions under specific conditions: such as when the property
            will be applied to the separate use of the wife, where the wife provides a consideration
            in exchange to the husband for the property, and where the husband makes a gift to
            "distinctly" separate it from "the mass of his property." The court decided in this
            case that a transfer of property did occur, and that it was exchanged for a "valuable
            consideration," essentially in lieu of alimony. The court concluded: "In regard to
            that property, Mrs. Wallingsford is to be considered as a 
            <em>feme sole</em>; and her right to dispose of it followed as a matter of course." In this petition
            for freedom case the deciding question became the legal capacity of slaveholding women
            to control and own enslaved property.
