         <p>Two of my negroes I am informed have assumed the Surname of Thomas and are about to
            apply to you to file petitions for their freedom, grounding their claim on a record
            from the General Court of Maryland It is certainly true that a negroe of the above
            name and possibly the same family obtained his freedom in the General Court, but his
            master (an old priest) made small defence. The same case was tried by the said family
            afterwards in the County Courts of Prince Georges, Charles and St Marys, and in Alexandria
            and decided uniformly against the petitioners. Mr. John Campbell now in Congress was
            their Counsel and to him I refer you for further particulars. Mr. P B Key was employed
            by the masters. The fact is that these fellows of  mine are two of the most worthless,
            drunken &amp; notorious scoundrels in the District &amp; knowing that Intended to send them
            to a farm in Charles County have adopted this expedient to prevent it Messrs Jones
            and Balch to whom they applyed in the first instance on hearing the Circumstances
            refused to have anything to do with it

         <p>It is probable that two slaves of mine who have assumed the surname of Thomas may
            apply to you to file petitions for their freedom having applyed already to almost
            every member of the Bar, who on hearing the circumstances of the case refused to have
            any thing to do with them. They ground their claim upon a record of the General Court
            of Maryland by which it appears that a negroe of that name was liberated, but in that
            case the master Mr Henry Pile a priest, being careless as to the issue of the suit
            made scarce any defence. Various members of the same family encouraged by the event
            of this suit, afterwards filed petitions in Charles &amp; Prince Georges Counties &amp; one
            in Alexandria (then Fairfax) and the decisions were uniformly against them, testimony
            obtained subsequent to the General Court, 
            <del class="division">division</del> Decision having placed the thing in quite a different point of view. The Honorable
            John Campbell a member of the 
            <del class="ho">ho</del> House of Representatives of the United States was counsel for the negroes, To him
            I refer you as he can give you more information on the subject than I can. The Records

            be obtained, the fact is that I intended to send to a farm in Maryland (from whence
            they came) these two fellows who are 
            <del class="two">two</del> the most worthless scoundrels in the District, to prevent which the idea of a suit
            suggested itself. I have also myself some thoughts of returning to Maryland, and a
            suit depending here would be inconvenient. As to their getting free, I have no Idea
            of it, under these circumstances especially after you refer to Mr. Campbell. I take
            it for granted that you will (should they apply to you) have nothing to do with the
            business as it can certainly put nothing into your pocket and may be troublesome to
            me.

            at the expence of 30 or $40 a year and he may live 30 or 40 years, AS.
