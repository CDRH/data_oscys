Such certificates were <del>always</del> 
            <del>ususally granted</del> never refused by said Lingan to persons removing into Maryland with Slaves, who <del>insisted upon</del> required such certificates; and the witness would not have given such a certificate as the paper aforesaid to any other person than the Deft. (<span class="unclear illegible">Mem.[?]</span> the said paper containing the said certificates was produced by the Petitioner's counsel.) and the Deft's counsel objected to the adoption in evidence of the certificates purported to be contained on the said paper. But the court <del>overruled the objection, and</del> admitted the said witness to testify to the said Jury in manner aforesaid and permitted the said first mentioned certificate so far as it precedes the name of James M Lingan to be read in Evidence to the Jury as explanatory of the testimony of the said Walter Smith, but refused <del>the</del> to permit the said paper or any part of it to be read in evidence to the Jury unaccompanied by the testimony of the said Walter Smith.
