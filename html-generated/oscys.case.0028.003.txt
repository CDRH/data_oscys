<p>That a negro girl named Sally then quite a child was a short time before the month of May 1810 <span class="unclear illegible">[sent?]</span> to live as a matter of favour with the deponent <span class="unclear illegible">[then?]</span> <del>residing in</del> on a visit to Virginia where the deponent lived on said visit for two years with her mother <del>safe but they</del> by Mr Henry W Ball, who also resided at that time in Fairfax County Virginia when the said negro girl was about 9 miles from Washington.

<p>Quest. Did you ever ask or obtain permission of Mr Ball to remove Sally to Washington? Ans: I cannot recollect, but Mr Ball was frequently in the habit of coming to our house, &amp; probably heard of our intention to remove to Washington. But <del>she</del> I do not know whether he <del>gave</del> was ever asked or gave permission for that removal of Sally. At the time of our removal Mr Ball was to the best of my recollection in Northumberland county Virginia, &amp; had gone there some time before our removal.</p>
                
<p>Quest. Did you not after your removal to Washington frequently pass backwards &amp; forwards to &amp; from Virginia, &amp; generally carry Sally with you. Ans: I did in several instances pass <del>back</del> to &amp; from Virginia to Washington, &amp; generally carried Sally with me. &amp; on these visits to Virginia, sometimes stayed a week or ten days. Sally once ran away from me while <del>there</del> here. &amp; went over to Virginia where the deponent sent after her.</p>
                
<p>Quest. How long did Sally remain with you in Washington, &amp; who took her away. Ans: Sally remained with me until after Mr Ball

<p>4. Did you or did you not know of Mr <del>W</del> H. W. Ball's ever residing in <del>Vir</del> Washington till after his marriage? Answers <del>she</del> He did not reside here till after his marriage — though he was frequently here.</p>
                
<p>5. When <del>did</del> was your Husband during the period of your aforesaid stay in Fairfax?</p>

<p>This Deponent always contemplated returning to Washington but did not suppose it would take place till late in the year, but Mr Rankin having obtained an appointment, they were induced to return earlier.</p>
