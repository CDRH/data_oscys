<p>It is admitted in this case that the Petrs Joe &amp; Nelly were the property of
John Thompson of St Mary's County in
the State of Maryland &amp; is the person named in the
annexed will of said Thompson <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span></p>
 
<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0036.013.002.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0036.013.002.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0036.013.002.jpg" class="display"/></a></span>
 
<p>It is also admitted that the said John Thompson died some
time in the year     180     making his will duly executed
&amp; recorded (a copy whereof is herewith exhibited) It is also admitted that
the widow of said Testator had no child born after the Testator's death and that
she, after his death, &amp; within the time limitted by law made in due form a
renunciation of her claim under the said will.</p>
 
<p>It is further admitted that the said Testator <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span></p>
 
<p>Child Sarah Anne has been born of the said
Nelly since the death of the Testator &amp; during the
period of servitude of her mother. It is also further admitted that the Deft
claims the Petitioners under the said Testator's widow, who took them claiming
that, in consequence of her renunciation of the will, she was entitlled to one
third of all her husbands personal assets not excluding the said negroes.
and that the said Petrs do not exceed what would be the widow's thirds of
Testator's negroes, if these negroes are not to be excluded.</p>
 
<p>Upon this statement it is  submitted to the Court to decide whether the claim of
the negroes under the will can be overthrown by the widow's renouncing it
&amp; whether the said child born in the time of her mother's servitude is a
slave for life, or bound to serve at all, or how long.</p>
