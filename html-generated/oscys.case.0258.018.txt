<p>Elisha Hall being sworn in due form of law deposeth &amp; saith, That he was sent for three days before the deep snow last writer, some time about the month of February by Mr. Alexander Scott, &amp; was requested by the said Alexander to take Walter a negro man belonging to the said Alexander to Mr. Johnson in Charles county, which this deponent promised to do. That the said Alexander did not wish the said Walter to be taken thro' town, as he did not wish any noise or disturbance to be made about it as his wife was sick. That the said Alexander then tied the said Walter &amp; delivered him to this deponent, who placed him on horseback, &amp; carried him to Charles county, by Tenley town &amp; Bladensburgh to Piscataway &amp; thence to Bryantown &amp; the Jail at Mr. Johnson, to whom this deponent had received letters from the said Alexander. That this deponent, together with James Thompson who accompanied him, saw the said Walter placed in Jail &amp; shortly after returned, &amp; further this deponent knoweth not.</p>
