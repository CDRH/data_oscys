         <p>Answer to 1st Interrogatory.<br/>
I did sell a negro woman named Charlotte, or Lotty, to Henry Clay, some time in the year 1806 for $450.</p>

         <p>Answer to 2nd. I cannot say positively but think Lotty was born in 1787. I bought her from Daniel Parker of Dorchester County Maryland, in the year 1796 or 7, at which time her master said she was nine years old. I removed her to Lexington Ky. in the year 1805.</p>

         <p>Answer 3d. I bought Lotty as a slave &amp; held her as such until 1806, when I sold her to Henry Clay</p>

         <p>Answer 4th. Lotty or Charlotte's mother was free at the time I purchased her (Lotty) she was emancipated by her husband one George Stanly who bought her from her master Daniel Parker, for that purpose, as I am informed &amp; believe.</p>

         <p>Answer 5th. I am not interested in the event of this suit, because I have in my possession &amp; have accepted from Henry Clay a full discharged from all manner of liability to him on account of said Negro Lotty.</p>

         <p>Answer 6. Lotty's mother often called to see her at my home in Maryland, &amp; never pretended that she was or should be free, nor did I ever hear any one else say so, until I heard of this suit. &amp; further deponent saith not</p>

         <p>Jas. Condon</p>

         <p>We John P. Erwin &amp; William Carroll, the Commissioners  named in the annexed Commission, do herby Certify, that we have taken the deposition of James Condon in the manner stated in the Caption and no other witness being produced on either the part of Plf or defendant, we have proceeded to <span class="unclear illegible">[close?]</span> sd. <span class="unclear illegible">[commissn?]</span>
