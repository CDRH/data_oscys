the wife of the Defendant and the same who executed said deed, voluntarily left her husbands House about the year 1819 or 1820, as well as Witness recollects, and took Sarah Ann with her to wait on her; that whilst Rachael remained with her husband Sarah Ann used to wait on her and be about the house; that Witness does not know why Rachael went away from her Husband; that she never had a fixed home after this, but lived about with her acquaintances in Prince George's County, in Maryland where Defendant resided, staying with first one and then the other and at times returning to her Husband's, and at other times going for a short time to Washington City to see her acquaintances there and then returning to Prince George's again; that she never did remain or fix her residence in Washington City; that Rachael sometimes had the negroes (Petitioners) with her in Prince George's and sometimes in Washington City.

than in Washington City and that she only went backwards and forwards from the one place to the other; that her conduct in so doing gave Defendant great unhappiness and distress of mind; that Defendant, to Witnesses knowledge, often entreated her to return and live with him as a wife ought to do and she always refused so to do; that this state of things produced great unhappiness with Defendant; that Defendant had been married before and had <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> his wife, by whom he had several children; that said Rachael was his second wife and they had no children.

County Court, <del class="during the time">during the time</del> to be paid during the pendency of a suit she had brought for alimony; that Defendant said he would agree to it, provided she would not harass him any more and would give up the $120 per year, otherwise he wanted said Petitioners to sell to pay the fine, it being his object in coming to the City to get them for that purpose, that said Rachael so

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0205.007.004.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0205.007.004.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0205.007.004.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

to agreed and appointed the next day to meet for the purpose of carrying said agreement into effect and <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> to have her lawyer Mr Key there; that witness and Defendant remained and went to the place fixed on and neither said Rachael or Mr Key attended. That the Defendant let said Petitioner go with said Rachael upon the evening, she made said proposition to him, thinking she would faithfully carry it into effect, which she did not, but instead of doing it, hid and concealed said Petitioners so that the Defendant could not find them, but was obliged to return home without them, and she kept them so concealed from that time until she came down to Defendants House when she died; she then brought them with her, but the woman Sarah Ann went off before her mistress died and was never heard of again until retaken by Witness. That after the death of said Rachael, the Witness as agent of Defendant heard Petitioners were in Washington City; that he came here to look for them and after some time and some search he found out where they were; that they are hid and concealed in a House of Saml. Brenton in said City; that He employed several constables to aid him in the taking of them viz, <span class="illegible">[Constably?]</span>, Waters, Stephenson and Ashton and that Ashton took the negroes from a room up stairs in Brenton's House and where they were <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> up and that he had to use <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> to get them. That the said Rachael exacted the payment of the amount allowed her by the Court from the Defendant notwithstanding she agreed not to do it, and the said Petitioners were left with her, on that condition alone. That Witness paid $20 himself to her on that account, after that time and that he knows Defendant had two of his negroes, the only two he had sold, for that purpose and to pay her

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0205.007.005.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0205.007.005.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0205.007.005.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

<p>The said Witness being <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> by Defendant, said that when Mr Ashton took sd negroes for Defendant they were put into jail by a Justice of the Peace, because they claimed their freedom and that Witness as agent for Defendant obtained from Judge Cranch a Habeus Corpus and that he decided they are not entitled to their freedom under said Deed from said Rachael, she being a feme coverte at the time and was about ordering them to be discharged and delivered to Defendant as his slaves, when the present suit was brought and <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> as Defendant whilst the
