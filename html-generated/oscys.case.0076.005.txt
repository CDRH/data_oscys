         <p>We of the Jury find that the negro girl, <del>was a sl</del> Joan or Johannah, on the 24th June 1797, was a slave the property of one Anthony Addison then a citizen of Maryland <span class="gap torn page">[torn page]</span> in the county of Prince Georges in the sd state where he <del>held</del> held her as <del>slave</del> a slave <del>for her</del> for life.</p>

         <p>If, upon the facts so found, the court be of opinion that the law is for the petitioner we find for the petitioners &amp; <span class="unclear illegible">[one?]</span>
