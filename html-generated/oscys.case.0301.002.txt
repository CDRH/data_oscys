Item. First, It is my will and desire, that after my death, all my just debts, including the necessary funeral expenses, shall be paid, out of any money or personal property I may leave.</p>

         <p>Item. Second It is further my will and desire, that my beloved wife, Ann Boothe, in the event of her surviving me, should possess and enjoy, all my property, real and personal, during her single life.
