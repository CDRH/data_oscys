      <div class="syllabus ">

Washington, and there sold by his master, the slave does not thereby acquire a
right to freedom.</p>

            <span class="smallcaps">This</span> was a petition for freedom.</p>

         <p>The petitioner was permitted to come from Virginia, to the city of Washington to
see his wife, and to return by a certain day; but he stayed some months longer, and
was taken up in Washington, by an agent of his owner, but escaped and eloped, and
the agent sold him to the defendant, while he was so eloped and while he was in the
city of Washington.</p>

         <p>The petitioner's counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury that upon the
state of facts the petitioner was entitled to his freedom.</p>

         <p>But the Court refused, and instructed the jury that he
was not entitled to his freedom under the <span class="bibl code">Maryland law of 1796, c. 67</span>.</p>
