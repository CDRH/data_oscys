         <p>I was well acquainted with Capt John B. Kirby and in his employment in his farm a
            great many years since, I remember his negro boy Harry, he was then an infant, when
            I was eighteen years old I left Captain Kirby, and remained about 
            <del class="till">till</del> for about two years when I returned. I cannot remember the year when I left him,
            but I distinctly recollect that I was about eighteen years of age and that Harry was
            then about two years old. I have known Harry from that time to this and feel satisfied
            that he is not at this time more than forty five if as much. I am not quite certain
            as to my age but I am somewhere between fifty eight and sixty years old, and Harry
            I believe is at this time between forty four and forty five years old.
