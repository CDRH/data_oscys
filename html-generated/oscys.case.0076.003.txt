            the expiration of the term aforesaid the said Walter Addison with the humane purpose
            of suffering her to reside with her husband exchanged the said Joanna with one Peter
            Savary to whom her said husband belonged for 
            <del class="the">the</del> a certain slave of Savary named Minty; that the agreement and understanding between

            term of twelve years the two slaves aforesaid should be returned to their respective
            owners and the issue, if any of said Joanna should serve the said Savary

            should arrive, the males at the age of thirty one years, and the females, at the age
            of twenty five years, respectively. And your Orators allege and believe that the said
            Peter Savary or his authorized representative was present and consulted at the making
            of said deed of manumission, 
            <del class="and was privy thereto,">and was privy thereto,</del> and asserted thereto because your
