            <del class="following">following</del> following record (here insert it) and propound to read only certain parts of it to
            the Jury leaving out some of the depositions included in the record, to the readings
            the said record in the whole the Petitioner objected, and insisted that if it was
            read then defendant who read it ought to read the whole, but the Court permitted it
            to be read and that the defendant shant read so much of it as he should think fit.
            To which opinion of the Court the Petitioner excepts &amp; prays that this her bill of
            exceptions may be signed, sealed &amp; enrolled which is done.
