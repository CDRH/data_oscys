         <p>Petition for freedom. The petitioners claimed freedom
            under the will of John Baptist Kirby, by which they were to
            be free at his death. Some of them were over forty-five years of age at the
            death of the testator.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Ashton, for the defendant,
            prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if any of the petitioners were over
            the age of forty-five at the testator's death, the manumission was void as to
            them; and cited 
            <div class="bibl case">Burrough v. Negro
               Anna, 4 Harr. &amp; Johns. 
            </div> and 
            <div class="bibl case">Hamilton v. Cragg, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 16 </div>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Coxe, contà. There were formerly, in
            Maryland, different opinions in regard to this question,
            but the Court of Appeals of Maryland have decided it
            since the formation of this district. While the law was unsettled in
            Maryland, this Court decided that the manumission was
            valid if provision was made by the testator against the slaves being a burden
            upon the public.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Previous to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of 1752, c. 1 </div>, manumission by will was lawful; otherwise
            that act would have been unnecessary, (see its preamble,) and the second
            section does not make void the manumission, but only subjects the party to a
            penalty, and obliges him to support the negro during his life, "whereby he
            may not become a burden to others, or perish through want, to the great
            scandal of christian society." The object of the 
            <div class="bibl code">thirteenth section of the
               Act of 1796, c. 67 
            </div>, is the same as that of the second section of the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of
               1752 
            </div>, which is repealed by the 
            <div class="bibl code">twelfth section of the Act of 1796 </div>. The
            interpretation should be in favor of liberty. "And," in the thirteenth
            section, should be constructed to be "or," so as to read thus, "unless the
            said

            slave or slaves shall be under the age of forty-five years," or able to work and
            gain a sufficient maintenance and livelihood." This testator has made sufficient
            provision for the maintenance of the old and infirm, as well as of the young.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Ashton, in reply. The
            legislature of 1796 intended to fix the rule of age as the qualification for
            manumission, in order to avoid disputes as to the ability of the slave to
            maintain himself, if over that age. It is a clear and definite line drawn; and
            although under forty-five, the negro must still be able to maintain himself.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court stopped Mr. Ashton, and said that the law of 1796
            was positive and clear, and that the decisions of the Court of Appeals of
            Maryland upon their own law are to be respected by this
            Court.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court (nem. con.) gave the
            instruction as prayed by Mr. Ashton.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Verdict and judgment accordingly.</p>
