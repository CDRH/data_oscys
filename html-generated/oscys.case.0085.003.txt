         <p>The Petition of Christopher Harris humbly represents. That in the year 1825, your
            petitioner was imported into the County aforesaid from the State of Virginia by one
            P.B. Alexander as her slave. That the said Alexander returned about six months ago
            to the said State of Virginia, leaving your petitioner in said County. That on the
            2nd day of February 1828, less than three years from the time your petitioner was
            imported into said County, the said Alexander sold your petitioner, at the City of
            Washington in said County to one Robert Rowley, a foreigner, who now holds and claims
            your petitioner as his slave. That your petitioner is advised that the said sale is
            contrary to law, and that your petitioner is entitled to his freedom. That the said
            Rowley has caused your Petitioner to be removed from the said County of Washington
            to the common jail of Alexandria County, where your petitioner is now confined, preparatory
            to his removal from this District. And your petitioner states further, that he has
            filed his petition on the Common law side of this Honorable Court against the said
            Rowley for his freedom. That the said Rowley is now about to remove your petitioner
            from this District, and unless he shall be enjoined and restrained by this Honorable
            Court from so doing your petitioner will be deprived of all benefit of said petition.
            Your
