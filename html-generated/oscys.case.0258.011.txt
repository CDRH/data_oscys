         <p>June 26th 1810</p>
         
         
         <p>Some time in the course of January 
            <del class="and February">and February</del> last Mr Alexander Scott came to me and informed me that two of his Negro men Walt
            &amp; Dennis were run away from him and that he was desirous of having them taken and
            brought home, that said negros had brought suit for their freedom which suits he had
            got Mr Balch Attorney for said negroes to have it struck off and that he was affraid
            that said negros would get some other Attorney to renew the suit again before he could
            get them taken therefore repeatedly pressed upon me to spare no pains to have them
            taken that he intended to send them to Charles County for he would rather they would
            bring such there than in the District that some of the same family had sued them before
            and could not obtain their Freedom
         </p>
         
         
         <p>I one day came to Mr Lindsays Tavern and asking a black man if he knew whether Mr
            Scotts Dennis was about the premises he said that he was and that he was in the stable
            recovering some fodder into the stable loft, I then went into the stable loft and
            took the said negro Dennis and took him to the barn of Mr Lindsays Tavern where Mr
            Lindsay was he asked me what I was going to do with the negro I told him that Mr Scott

            had sent me for him he asked me if I had an order for him I told him that Mr Scott
            had given me an order some time before that and that I had tore it up or left it behind
            as I had come there before for the Negro and he had got alarmed and ranaway from Mr
            Lindsays therefore I neglected the order he then said that I should not take the negro
            away that the time he had hired the negro for had not expiered and that the fellow
            was as much his as he was Mr Scotts for the term he had hired him for but if I would
            bring an order from Mr Scott that he would at any time give up the negro
