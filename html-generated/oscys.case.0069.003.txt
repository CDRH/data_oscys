To which the Deft. replied <del>that he had a good opinion if the woman (that is the slave) wished to do her service, and intended to set her free upon being repaid the money he was to advance for her: the witness then put into deft's hands $40 to be paid to Mrs Greenfield in part payment of the purchase-money. This sum</del>

That he was about to make the said purchase from motives only of christian charity &amp; to <span class="unclear illegible">[grace?]</span> the said woman of whom he had a great opinion &amp; whom he thought it his duty to service, that he had confidence in her that she would repay him what he should advance &amp; that she should then be free. The Witness told him that if that was his object in making said purchase he would, if he denied it, be security for Letty for 50.$ that she would pay up in overall sums what he might advance &amp; that he would moreover put in his hands 40.$. Then, to enable him to make the first payment for Letty— the Deft declined <del>taking the</del> requiring the security, saying he had confidence in the woman, but agreed to receive the 40.# which the Witness therefore paid him. The Witness got the said 40.$ from a coloured woman to whom Letty told him to apply for it, saying that it had been contributed by some friends of hers for the purpose of enabling her to buy herself of her said Mistress. And this sum <del>of</del> of 40.$ the Witness had received from said woman &amp; was holding the same to be applied <del>for</del> to the purpose for

         <p>And the said Witness further proved that after said bargain, the Deft. never claimed nor held the Petr in his service, but that she lived at large, as a free woman in the City of Washington, where Deft also lived. And that after said bargain &amp; while so living at large, the child mentioned in the petition was born. That Deft after receiving the 40$ paid it to Mrs Greenfield, <del>who</del> but no information was given to her of the object of Deft in making said purchase.</p>
