<div class="body ">

<p>The Petition of Kitty Shorter in behalf of
herself and her infant children William
and <del class="Charles">Charles</del> Nancy humbly
sheath unto your Honours that your petitioners are free persons descended in the
female line direct from a free white woman and are unjustly detained in slavery
by a certain Daniel Rapine, of the County
of Washington aforesaid, as they are prepared to verify. They therefore pray that your Honours will take into consideration, their case, and that you will be pleased to cause the U.S. writ of subpoena to issue to the said Daniel Rapine, and that your petitioners may have a trial according to law, and that such other and farther process may be ordered there in as to your Honours may seem reasonable and just. And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.</p> 

<p>D. A. Hall for Petitioners</p>
