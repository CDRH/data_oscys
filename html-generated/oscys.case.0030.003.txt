<p>State of Virginia Northumberland County set.</p>
                
<p>William Ball of the county of Northd of lawful age being by me duly sworne to make true answers to foregoing interrogatories, deposeth &amp; sayeth &amp; followeth — to the first interrogatory that he does know the petitioners Violet and her children Winny and Chloe. That he has known Violet from <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> child, and her two children the petitioner this affiant <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> about three years after the defendant <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> Henry W. Ball his affiant also knows and has known from his birth— he being a younger brother of this affiant</p>

<p>To the second Inter. he saeth that Violet was born in and raised in Virginia. And removed from this county about seven years ago to Fairfax by the defendant— but when and by whom she was removed to the District of Columbia, this affiant of his own knowlege knows not—she was then the property of the defendant</p>
                
<p>To the third Int saeth affiant that he knows not how <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> District of Columbia. She <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> the spring of 1811—to the best of this affiants recollection—with her two children—the petitioner— by the permission of her master—the deft on a visit to her husband she had not been <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> sold—nor can this affiant say positively that he was <span class="unclear illegible">[connected?]</span> or requested by the deft to make sale of the petitioner or either of <span class="unclear illegible">[the?]</span> that this affiant did not sell nor did any others sell or appear to sell them in Virginia pursuant to such direction—</p>
                               
<p>to the fourth Inter. he saeth that Violet and her children were sent back to Washington by the deft in the summer or fall of 1811— and  that <span class="unclear illegible">[between?]</span> nothing <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> to <span class="unclear illegible">[deny?]</span> sale of the petitioner not included in this foregoing interrogatories and the answers <span class="unclear illegible">[therto?]</span>.</p>
                    
<p>Question by the defts counsel— After having been permitted by her master the deft. to return to Virginia on a visit to her husband—Did or did not Violet refuse to return to his services which required by him. State your knowledge fully on this subject—</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0030.003.004.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/large/oscys.case.0030.003.004.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://cdrhsites.unl.edu/figures/oscys/thumbnails/oscys.case.0030.003.004.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>
           
<p>Answer. After Violet and her children had remained a month or two in this county — this affiants having been requested by the deft by letter to take them in his possession and procured a conveyance for them to Washington— went to Mount Zion. Where they then were and pursuant to to the request of the deft. directed her to return with her children to the  house of this affiant which she promised to do. She then went to get her clothes— and <span class="gap illegible">[illegible]</span> so that she could not be found, when this affiant was about to return home— he then took her two children—the petitioners—home with him. and they remained at this affiants house until after the arrival in Northumberland in the course of the following summer of the deft by whom directions <del>were</del> Violet and her children were sent up to Washington by <span class="unclear illegible">[water?]</span> she having absconded from the possession of this affiant until after her masters arrival—and further this affiant saeth not.</p>
