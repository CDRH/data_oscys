         <p>I admit that the facts have in substance been correctly stated in the petition of Negro Letty. She had appealed to me as an old family servant, &amp; at her urgent request I purchased her under a compromise of a doubtful claim which she was then making to her freedom. And it was arranged that I was to emancipate her as soon as she returned the $100 I paid for her. Of this sum she has returned me no part. I have neither taken her into possession or exercised any act of ownership over her, being content to put up with this loss; but do not think I am bound to incur any further responsibility for her by a voluntary emancipation as she is now more than forty five years of age. I am willing the Court shall enter such judgment as shall seem proper.</p>
