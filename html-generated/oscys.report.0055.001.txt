§ 29</span>, required two witnesses. The master afterwards carried them to Virginia, where he died, having by his will left them free at the age of twenty-five. The petitioner's mother, one of those slaves, was living in Virginia at the death of the testator; after whose death, and before the petitioner's mother had attained the age of twenty-five, that is, before she was actually free, the petitioner was born, in Virginia.</p>

         <p>Mr. Key, for the defendant, contended that the petitioner, under those circumstances, was born a slave, and cited the case of <span class="bibl case">Maria and others v. Surbaugh, 2 Rand. Rep. 228</span>; in which the Court of Appeals of Virginia unanimously decided, that where a testator bequeathes a female slave on condition that she shall be free at a certain age, and before that period arrives she has issue, such issue are slaves; and</p>

         <p>This Court (Thruston, J., <em class="term">contrà</em>,) decided accordingly.</p>

         <p>Judgment for the defendants.</p>
