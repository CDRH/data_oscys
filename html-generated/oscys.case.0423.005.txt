That the annexed certificate, duly accorded in Washington County, relates to the same two slaves. That the said slaves both continued to reside in Washington County D.C. from the time of their importation as aforesaid until the Eleventh day of June last when this deponent sent them to Alexandria not to reside but to be sold to a foreign trader in slaves; and upon the said slaves being brought into Alexandria County, had them carried immediately to the negro jail of the above named defendant where they remained in confinement until the tenth day of July when they were sold by the deponent to one Callaway to be exported from the said District of Columbia: and that thereupon, and while the said slaves continued confined in the said Jail, the proceedings hereinbefore entitled were instituted for them. And thereupon the deponent refunded the purchase money and resumed his right to the said slaves. That in fact the said slaves have never had or acquired any

         <p>that your honble Court has no jurisdiction to try the question their freedom, if any question there be; because the said slaves have never resided and do not reside in the County of Alexandria.</p>
