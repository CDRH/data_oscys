         <p>Interrogatories to be answered by Miss Jones on the part of the Petitioners. —</p>
             
         <p>1st. Do you know the Petitioners &amp; where did they reside before they were brought to the City of Washington? &amp; about what time were they removed?</p>
                
         <p>The petitioner Violet is a native of the State of Virginia &amp; County of
Northumberland—where she remained all her life—until the
                    spring of 1807—at which time—by the authority of Henry Waring Ball (whoes property she
                    became by his marriage with Sally Shelton Jones—) She was
                    removed with other property of his to Fairfax County
                        Virginia—And when Violet
                    was originally brought or sent to the city of
                        Washington—Elizath L. Jones knows nothing abt.</p>
                
         <p>2nd. Did the said Petitioners after their removal
                    to Washington &amp; when, return to the State of Virginia?</p>
                
         <p>Some time in the month of March or (April)
                    1811—Violet—together with her two
                    children—Winifred &amp; Chloe—(all the property of Henry W. Ball—) arrived in
                    Northumberland County State of
                        Virginia—From the City of Washington—</p>
                
         <p>3. Did you understand from Violet on her said return from for what purpose she
                    returned &amp; did you ever afterwards in a conversation with the Deft
                    communicate what Violet had said upon that subject &amp; did he
                    deny having sent her to Virginia to be sold?—</p>
                
         <p>Violet said that her-self and children were to be
                    disposed of by sale and that she had requested her Master Henry W. Ball—to allow her to be sold in
                    the neighbourhood where her husband Emanuel lived—and that
                    Major Ball—was to attend to the
                    business.—</p>

         <p>4. Where did the said Violet stay while in Virginia after her return there? Did
                    she stay at Mr Gordon's — By whose consent &amp; direction &amp; for what purpose did
                    she stay there &amp; how long &amp; when she did leave there.—</p>
                
         <p>From early in April 1811—until about the 9th of July 1811—Violet stayed at Mount
                            Sion Northumberland Virginia—and was
                    employed as a domestic in William
                        Gordon's family—who several times mentioned in the presence
                    and hearing of Elizth L. Jones—some doubts whether he could obtain—a good title to Violet and her children—Winifred—and Chloe—as he was a resident in the
                    State of Virginia—</p>
                
         <p>5. Did you see Major Ball at Mr Gordon's or
                    elsewhere after Violet's return to
                    Virginia—Did or or did he not say he
                    was ordered or authorized by his Brother the Deft to sell her &amp; her
                    children—Did he or did he not offer to sell her &amp; children to Mr Gordon
                    &amp; were they sent there—did they remain there &amp; for how long with Major Ball's
                    consent &amp; knowledge or direction—Did you see him when he came there to order
                    the Petitioners to the Court House to be seen by a Slave Trader &amp; what did you hear him say at that time?—</p>
                
         <p>Elizth L. Jones did see Major William Ball—at Mount
                        Sion (the the residence of William Gordon) after Violets return to Virginia—and
                    while she was in the service of William Gordons Family—and when he went to Mr
                    Gordons to give orders to
                    Violet for her self and children to go to
                    Northumber. Court House Virginia—for
                    the purpose of shewing them to a slave trader at that place—which circumstance
                    occurred on or about the 9th of July 1811—When by the
                    request of Violet—Elizth L.
                        Jones took upon herself—to make application to Major
                    Wm Ball—to postpone the disposal
                    of the woman &amp; her children—until she could get a letter wrote—to her
                    Master, Henry W. Ball, or until
                    he arrived in Northum. as was then expected—Major Ball replied to Elizth L.
                                Jones—that a much longer time had elapsed than he wished
                    in complying with that request of his brother Henry W. Ball—who had wrote to
                    him very pressingly to dispose of Violet
                    and her children—by sale— That for his own part it was a very disagreeable price
                    of business—to him, and that he wished he had nothing to do with it—But that was
                    his brother Henry had requested it—that he (Major Ball) hated to refuse him—adding
                    that—Violet had been very impertinent to Mr. Ball—and that his Brother was very much in a want of the money.—</p>
                
         <p>Major Ball then observed that Violet had no occasion to be contrary about going
                    to the Court House—that he had given his word to shew her &amp; her children to the
                    slave trader there—But that he did not think it probable that the man w. give
                    the price which he sh. require for Violet
                    and her two children—&gt;Winifred &amp;
                    Chloe—and seprated his <span class="unclear illegible">[finl?]</span> orders—to
                    her—that her-self and children must go to Northumberland Court
                        House;——Violet then
                    collected some articles of clothing <span class="unclear illegible">[&amp;cc?]</span> and with her two
                    children, Winifredand Chloe, left Mount
                            Sion—then the residence of Mr Gordon—apparently for the purpose
                    of going to Northum. Court House—agreeable to
                    the instructions of Major Ball—But the morning following Violets two children being discovered in
                    Mr. Gordons kitchen—the
                    presumtion then was—that she did not obey the orders of Major Ball respecting her going to the
                    Court House—But had some where concealed her self—And in
                    the course of the same day, which the children of Violet were discovered to be at
                    Mount Sion—Major Ball sent a servant for them to be carried to his plantation (or mill—),——</p>

         <p>6th. Did you in a conversation with H.W. Ball afterward communicate to him what Major Ball did &amp; said at the time aforesaid
                    &amp; did he or did he not deny having requested or ordered the said Major Ball to sell the Petitioners.— &amp; Did he
                    or not deny having sent her &amp; her children to
                    Virginia to be sold? and what did he say at the time? Did
                    you mention to him that it was thought or said Violet could not be sold in
                    Virginia &amp; what did he say, &amp; what did he direct
                    you to do &amp; how &amp; when did Violet
                    &amp; her children return to Washington?</p>
                
         <p>In the course of the month of July 1811—and after the
                    9th (of said month) Henry W. Ball arrived in
                    Northumberland—and at Mount Sion—(then the residence of
                    William Gordon) where Elizth L.
                            Jones then was—who recollects—that the subject
                    of Violets—being for sale was several
                    times conversed on by Henry W. Ball and
                    her-self—Which introduced the subject she does not remember, nor suppose of any
                    importance—But Elizth L. Jones—certainly related the
                    distress of Violet (to
                    (H.W. Ball) when Major Ball ordered her to go to
                    North. Court House—and also the
                    part she took in behalf of the sale of Violets being postponed until a letter
                    could be forwarded or until Henry W. Ball himself sh. arrive in
                    Northum. and he
                    did not deny having authorized, or requested, his Brother Major Ball, to dispose
                    of Violet and her children by sale—and Henry W. Ball stated as his Brother had
                    before done—that Violet had conducted her-self very unbecomingly to her mistress
                    (Mrs Ball) to which Elizth L. Jones
                    replied that Violet could be hired out—if
                    she did not conduct her-self to the satisfaction of Mrs
                    Ball—and <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Henry W.​ ">W. Henry</a>
    ​ Ball
                    reply to that was that Violet wd. not
                    agree to be hired out in the City—Where he had proposed— and it then appeared as if she
                    was immediately sent down to Northumd and power vested in the hands of Major Ball to dispose of her by sale—But to
                    whom, or where he was instructed to sell Violet and her children is impossible for
                    Elizth L. Jones to say—It is more than probable that she
                    mentioned to Henry W. Ball—the doubts which Mr. Gordon had expressed relative to his
                    obtaining a sufficient title for Violet and her children—supposing he had
                    purchased them—and Elizth L Jones is also under the impression that she inquired of <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="H. W.​ ">W. H</a>
    ​
                        Ball—whether it never occured to him—that Violet could not loyally be disposed of in
                            Virginia—and to the best of her recollection on
                    that point—He said he wished to give her a chance of being disposed of in the
                    neighbourhood of her Husband Emanuel if it could be
                    done—But did not <span class="unclear illegible">[occupy?]</span> him self fully on the subject—Elizth L.
                            Jones—being interested in the fate of Violet (then <span class="unclear illegible">[making?]</span> reference to what W. Ball had said respecting her
                    not agreeing to be hired out in the City—) observed that
                    she was concerned now that Violet had
                    found—some difficulty in getting a resident of Virginia
                    to purchase her, Her that she wd. be willing to return to Washington and said
                    all she would to prevail on Mr. Ball to give her another trial.— And after some
                    days had passed and during Mr. Balls stay at Mount Sion—He told Elizth
                        L. Jones—that he had some where seen Emanuel
                    the Husband of Violet (it is necessary to
                    observe—that Violet still continued to
                    conceal her-self from the 9th of July) &amp; who
                    said she wd. make her appearance to her Master—and then w. be willing to return
                    to the City of Washington—or receive his instructions what she sh do—</p>             
                
         <p>Mr. Ball—did not see Violet as he expected from what
                    Emanuel had told him—and
                    upon his leaving North. for the City
                            of Washington—Mr. Ball requested Elizth L.
                                    Jones—to inform Violet—(shd. she go to
                    Mount Sion that it was his instructions that she sh.
                    return to Washington—when Captn <span class="unclear illegible">[Masles?]</span> vessel
                    saild from <span class="unclear illegible">[Cane?]</span> River, which was about the latter part
                    of August—and accordingly Violet—went to
                    Mount Sion—to receive her Masters orders—which were left
                    with with Elizth L Jones for her—And Violet said if she could collect some articles
                    of hers which she wished to carry with her—she shd. go—But the before being
                    expected to sail that day—Violet did not
                    get ready to go that opportunity—Nor did Elizth L Jones—see her again, until
                    October—when she endeavourd to learn where Violet was—And was informed, that she
                    had been amongst her Husbands relations and had been sick—(Still in
                    Northd Va)—And why it was any concert of Elzth
                            Jones's—where Violet
                    was—as when she wd. leave Northumd. was in consequence of her receiving a letter from H.W. Ball—wherein he requested her—to
                    make use of her <span class="unclear illegible">[enarticles?]</span> to get Violet off as speedily as possible, for
                    Washington City—And accordingly she left
                    Northd Virga in the early part of October
                            1811—agreeable to her Masters instructions which were made known
                    to her thro. the medium of Elizth L. Jones,——</p>

                    the Deft to sell Violet and her children—, at which time he very decidedly (and
                    at Mount Sion) informed her that his brother Henry W. Ball had requested him by letter
                    to dispose of Violet and her children by
                    sale—adding that a much longer time had elapsed than he wished in complying with
