         <p>The petition of Walter Thomas, and Dennis Thomas, humbly sheweth: that they are held
            in slavery by Alexander Scott, of the county of Washington, and District of Columbia,
            and they are advised that they are entitled to be free, being descended from a free
            white woman whose name was Elizabeth Thomas, in the female line. They therefore pray
            your honours, the premises considered to discharge them from the custody of the said
            Alexander Scott, if they should prove their descent as aforesaid; and that summons
            may issue for the said Alexander Scott to answer this petition, and they will pray
            and so forth.
