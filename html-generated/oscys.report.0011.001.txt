         <p>Negro Samuel Bias v. John Rose.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="syllabus ">

         <p>A slave brought into the county of Washington from Maryland, by his owner, and within three years thereafter mortgaged for his full value, does not thereby acquire a right to his freedom.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="body ">
 
         <p>This was a petition for freedom, submitted to the Court by
Mr. Key, for the petitioner, and Mr. Jones, for the defendant,
upon a case in which it was stated that the petitioner was brought
into this county from Maryland, by one Richards, his owner,
and within three years thereafter was mortgaged by Richards to
W. Bowie, who assigned the mortgage to the defendant, who
holds the petitioner under the mortgage. That Richards became
insolvent, and was discharged under the insolvent act of the
District of Columbia.</p>
                
         <p>The petitioner claims his freedom under the <span class="bibl code">Act of Maryland,
of 1796, c. 67, §§ 1, 2, and 3</span>. The first section is general, and
prohibits the importation of slaves to reside, or for sale, and declares that if so imported they shall be free. The second section
excepts slaves brought in by citizens of the United States, coming
with a <em class="term">bonâ fide</em> intention of settling in the State; but the third
section says that nothing in the act-contained shall be construed
to enable any person, so removing, to sell or dispose of any slave
so imported, unless such person shall have resided within the
State three whole years next preceding such sale.</p>
                
         <p>The Court (Thruston, J., not sitting,) was of opinion that
the law was against the petitioner, and rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>
