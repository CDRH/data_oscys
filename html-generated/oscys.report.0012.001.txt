         <p>Length of time does not raise a presumption against a
            slave, that his owner took the oath required by law.

         <p>Petition for freedom. The petitioner was carried,
            by his owner, from Maryland to
            Virginia, in the year 1784, and kept there several
            years, and then brought back to Maryland. By the 
            <div class="bibl code">law
               of Virginia of 17th of
               December, 1792, p. 186 
            </div>, the slave was entitled to his freedom,
            unless the owner took a certain oath within sixty days after his removal to
            Virginia.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Key and Mr. Caldwell, for the defendant,
            moved the Court to instruct the jury, that after such a lapse of time they
            have a right to presume that the oath was duly taken agreeably to law. The
            law did not require that there should be any record of the taking of the
            oath. It is a fact which may be proved by parol. Judge
            White in Virginia has decided in
            favor of the presumption.

         <p>Mr. Taney and Mr. Jones, contrà, stated that
            there is a contrary decision in 
            <div class="bibl case">5 Munford, 542 </div>, and that Judge
            Dade had decided in the same way. The presumption could
            arise only from the acquiescence of the petitioner; but that presumption is
            rebutted by the state of slavery in which he has been held, which disabled
            him from asserting his rights.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court (Cranch, C. J., doubting,) refused
            to give the instruction.
