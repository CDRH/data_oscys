            wages to her own use, which she did until the return of her master, who was reelected,
            and who, at her request, offered to sell her to her husband, a free colored
            man, residing in Washington, for $400, if he could raise the money, but he could
            not, and never paid it, or any part of it.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court (nem. con.) refused to instruct the jury that these facts were not evidence
            of
            an importation, contrary to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Maryland Act of 1796, c. 67 </div>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>They also refused to instruct the jury, that, upon that evidence, they ought to find
            their verdict for the defendant; but instructed them that the petitioner is not entitled
            to freedom under the first section of the act, unless she was brought into this
            county, by the defendant, for sale, or to reside therein; and that the circumstances
            stated, although found by the jury, are not conclusive evidence that the petitioner
            was brought into this county with such intent, or for sale; and that the residence
            contemplated by the first section of the act is a permanent residence, as contradistinguished
            from a sojournment.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Court also refused to instruct the jury, that the defendant's offer and agreement
            to sell the petitioner to her husband, under the circumstances stated, was evidence
            of an importation, contrary to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of 1796, c. 67 </div>, unless the jury should
            believe, from the circumstances given in evidence, that the defendant had no intention,
            at the time of importation, that she should be sold, or should reside in this
            county.

         <p>The petitioner, negro Maria, claimed her freedom by reason
            of importation, contrary to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of Maryland, 1796, c. 67 </div>;
            by the first section of which it is enacted, "that it shall not be
            lawful to import or bring into this State, by land or water, any
            negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside within this
            State. And any person brought into this State as a slave, contrary
            to this act, if a slave before, shall thereupon cease to be
            the property of the person or persons so importing, &amp;c., and shall
            be free."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By the fourth section it is provided, "that nothing in this act
            contained shall be construed or taken to affect the right of any
            person or persons travelling or sojourning with any slave or
            slaves within this State, such slave or slaves not being sold, or
            otherwise disposed of in this State, but carried out of this State,
            or attempted to be carried."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Upon the trial, evidence was given to prove that the petitioner
            was the slave cf the defendant, a resident of the Territory of Florida,
            and the delegate in Congress from that Territory. That he
            brought the slave to Washington to wait upon his family, while
            he was attending Congress, in the winter of 1828 - 1829. That
            she remained with his family during the session; but, at the
            end of the session, on the 4th of March, 1829, was too far
            advanced in pregnancy to be removed, with safety, to Florida;
            and was, therefore, left by her master in Washington. That, at
            her request, after her confinement, she was permitted by her
            master, who was reelected, to hire herself out in Washington,
            until he should return to Congress, in December, 1829; which
            permission was given by a writing inclosed in a letter to Mr.
            French, the agent of the defendant. That she accordingly hired

         <p>herself out, and received her wages to her own use. That the
            defendant, learning that she had a free husband in Washington,
            and that she wished to live with him, agreed that if he could
            raise $400 for him he should have her. That the money was
            never raised, nor any part of it ever paid to the defendant.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Upon this evidence, Mr. Key, for the petitioner, prayed the
            Court to instruct the jury, that if, from the evidence, they found
            the facts to be as above stated, then the continuing of the petitioner
            in this county, under such circumstances, is evidence of
            an importation contrary to the 
            <div class="bibl code">law of 1796, c. 67 </div>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But the Court (nem. con.) refused to give the instruction.</p>
         
         
         <p>Whereupon Mr. Swann, for the defendant, prayed the Court
            to instruct them, that upon these facts, if believed by them, they
            ought to find their verdict for the defendant.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Which instruction the Court refused to give; but instructed
            them that the petitioner is not entitled to freedom under the
            first section of the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of 1796, c. 67 </div>, unless she was brought
            into this county by the defendant for sale, or to reside therein;
            that the circumstances aforesaid, although proved to the satisfaction
            of the jury, are not conclusive evidence that the petitioner
            was brought into this county with such intent, or for sale; and
            that the residence contemplated in the first section of the act is
            a permanent residence, as contradistinguished from a sojournment.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Mr. Key then prayed the Court to instruct the jury, that "if
            they believed that the defendant contracted with the husband of
            the petitioner, (a free man,) for the purchase of the petitioner, at
            the price of $400, and that the said husband agreed to pay the
            said sum of money, as the price of the petitioner; then such
            contract is evidence of an importation contrary to the 
            <div class="bibl code">Act of
               Assembly of 1796 
            </div>. Unless the jury should, from the circumstances
            given in evidence, believe that the defendant had no
            intention, when he brought in the petitioner, of her being sold, or
            residing in this county."
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But the Court refused to give the said instruction. And
            Cranch, C. J., suggested a doubt, whether a slave gained his
            freedom, under the third section of the act, by being sold within
            three years after being imported, if he was not originally imported
            for sale, or to reside.
