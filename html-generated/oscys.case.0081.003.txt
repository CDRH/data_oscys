         <p>On the trial of this cause the petitioner (a negro and a 
            <span class="illegible">[native?]</span> born slave of Virginia) to prove the issue on his part proved by a witness that the
            Deft himself removed to Georgetown in the District of Columbia, from Virginia 
            <del class="some time">some time</del> on the 2d of June in the year 1813, and has resided here ever since having 
            <span class="illegible">[hired?]</span> a house in Georgetown in the district &amp; removed his wife &amp; 
            <span class="illegible">[white?]</span>  family into it in May in the same year, and the residue of his family in June aforesaid.
            That some time after his removal (but how long after the witness has no recollection)
            the petitioner came to the house of Deft in Georgetown, and has ever since been held
            by deft as his slave: and here the petitioner rested his case: wherefore the Deft
            insisted &amp; moved the Court, that, upon 
            <del class="such">such</del> the said testimony standing alone, the Deft was not put to prove either that the
            petitioner was the property of the Deft at the time 
            <del class="he">he</del> of the removal of the latter or that the time of the petitioner's removal into this
            County was within a year after the Deft's removal: But the court overruled the point
            so insisted on by Deft and decided that it was not competent for the Jury to infer
            from said evidence

            either the property in Deft at the time of his own removal, or the importation within
            a year thereafter: and that the burden of proving as well the original property in
            Deft at the time of his removal, and the importation of the petitioner within the
            year 
            <span class="illegible">[illegible]</span> still rested on Deft. To which decision the Deft. excepts.

         <p>And in the further progress of the trial after the petitioner had produced &amp; read
            in Evidence a letter from the Deft's agent Elijah Chamberlain in these words, the
            Deft, is order to prove when he gave up possession of a certain mill in Virginia which
            he had owned &amp; managed as his business &amp; calling in Virginia, proved that prior to
            his said removal from Virginia he had sold the said mill to one Mussleman, but continued
            in possession of the same at the time of his removal and did not take possession of
            the mill purchased by him in this county till the 1st July 1813; and then offered
            to prove 
            <del class="by prov">by prov</del> that both the Deft &amp; said Mussleman had told the witness, prior to the removal of
            the former in 1813, that possession of the mill in Virginia was to be delivered by
            Deft to Mussleman on the 1st July 1813. To the admission of which latter Evidence
