         <p>I am well informed, and <span class="gap strikethrough">[strikethrough]</span> believe the fact to be so that about four years since a Mulatto Woman named Lucy the property of one of the Mr Lyle's was brought from Maryland to Alexandria, and I understand hath since been sold to Charles Slade. I have searched the Records of Alexandria County Court, and do not find any entry was made of the Importation of said Woman Lucy. And am therefore of opinion that she is entitled to her Freedom. Given under my Hand this 24th day of June 1805.<br/>
