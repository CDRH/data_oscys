<p>Mima Queen and Child, Petitioners for Freedom, v. Hepburn.</p>

<p>7 C. 290.</p>

</div>

<div class="syllabus ">

<p>Hearsay evidence is incompetent to establish a specific fact, which is, in its nature, susceptible of being proved by witnesses who speak from their own knowledge. Claims to freedom in Maryland are not exempt from that general rule.</p>

<p>After a juror is sworn, no exception can be taken to him by a party, on account of his being an inhabitant of another county.</p>

<p>If a juror be challenged for favor, and, upon examination before the tryers, he declare that, if the evidence should be equal, he should give a verdict in favor of that party upon whom the burden of proof lies, the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, ought to reject him, although the bias should not be so strong as to render it positively improper to allow him to be sworn.</p>

<p>Error to the circuit court for the District of Columbia, sitting at Washington.</p>

<p>At the trial, several bills of exception were taken, the substance whereof is given in the opinion of the court.</p>

<p>F. S. Key and Morsell, for the plaintiffs in error.</p>

<p>Law and Jones, contrà.</p>

<p>Marshall, C. J., delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:—</p>

<p>This was a suit instituted by the plaintiffs in the circuit court of
the United States for the county of Washington, in which they claim
freedom. On the trial of the issue, certain depositions were offered
by the plaintiffs which were rejected by the court, and exceptions
were taken. The verdict and judgment being rendered for the defendants, the plaintiffs have brought the cause into this court by writ
of error, and the case depends on the correctness of. the several
opinions given by the circuit court.</p>

<p>The first opinion of the court to which exception was
taken, was for the rejection of part of the deposition of
Caleb Clarke, who deposed to a fact which he had heard his mother
say she had frequently heard from her father.</p>

<p>The second exception is to the opinion overruling part of the de-

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.002.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.002.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/thumbnails/oscys.report.0002.002.002.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

position of Freeders Ryland, which stated what he had heard Mary,
the ancestor of the plaintiffs, say respecting her own place of birth
and residence.</p>

<p>The fifth exception is substantially the same with the second.
The question is somewhat varied in form, and the testimony given
by the defendant, to which no exception was taken, is recited, and
the hearsay evidence is then offered as historical; but the court perceives
no difference, in law, between the second and fifth exceptions.
The sixth exception is taken to an instruction given by the court
to the jury on the motion of the counsel for the defendants. The
plaintiffs had read the deposition of Richard Disney, who deposed
that he had heard a great deal of talk about Mary Queen, the ancestor
of the plaintiffs, and has heard divers persons say that Captain
Larkin brought her into this country, and that she had a great many
fine clothes, and that old William Chapman took her on shore once,
and that nobody would buy her for some time, until at last James
Caroll bought her.</p>

<p>Whereupon the defendant's counsel moved the court to instruct
the jury that if they find the existence of this report and noise was
not stated by the witness from his knowledge, but from what had
been communicated to him respecting the existence of such a report
and noise many years after her importation, without its appearing
by whom or in what manner the same was communicated
to him, then the evidence is incompetent to prove either the existence
of such report and noise or the truth of it; which instruction the
court gave.</p>
 
<p>The plaintiffs also read the deposition of Thomas Warfield, who
deposed that John Jiams, an inspector of tobacco, told him that Mary, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, * was free, and was
brought into this country by Captain Larkin, and was sold
for seven years. The court instructed the jury that if they should
be satisfied upon the evidence that these declarations of John Jiams
were not derived from his own knowledge, but were founded on
hearsay or report communicated to him many years after the importation
and sale of the said Mary, without its appearing by whom or
in what manner such communication was made to him; then his
said declarations are not competent evidence in this cause. To these
instructions the counsel for the plaintiffs excepted.</p>
 
<p>These several opinions of the court depend on one general principle,
the decision of which determines them all. It is this: That
hearsay evidence is incompetent to establish any specific fact, which
fact is in its nature susceptible of being proved by witnesses who
speak from their own knowledge.</p>
 
<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.003.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.003.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/thumbnails/oscys.report.0002.002.003.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

<p>However the feelings of the individual may be interested on the
part of a person claiming freedom, the court cannot perceive any
legal distinction between the assertion of this and of any other right,
which will justify the application of a rule of evidence to cases of
this description which would be inapplicable to general cases in
which a right to property may be asserted. The rule, then, which the
court shall establish in this cause will not, in its application, be confined
to cases of this particular description, but will be extended to
others where rights may depend on facts which happened many years
past.</p>

<p>It was very justly observed by a great judge, that "all questions upon
the rules of evidence are of vast importance to all orders and degrees
of men; our lives, our liberty, and our property, are all concerned in
the support of these rules, which have been matured by the wisdom
of ages, and are now revered from their antiquity and the good sense
in which they are founded."</p>

<p>One of these rules is, that "hearsay" evidence is in its own nature
inadmissible. That this species of testimony supposes some better
testimony which might be adduced in the particular case, is
not the sole ground of its exclusion. Its intrinsic weakness
its incompetency to satisfy the mind of the existence of
the fact, and the frauds which might be practised under its cover, combine
to support the rule that hearsay evidence is totally inadmissible.
To this rule there are some exceptions which are said to be as old
as the rule itself. These are cases of pedigree, of prescription, of
custom, and in some cases, of boundary. There are also matters of
general and public history which may be received without that full
proof which is necessary for the establishment of a private fact.</p>

<p>It will be necessary only to examine the principles on which these
exceptions are founded, to satisfy the judgment that the same principles will not justify the admission of hearsay evidence to prove a
specific fact, because the eye-witnesses to that fact are dead. But if
other eases standing on similar principles should arise, it may well
be doubted whether justice and the general policy of the law would
warrant the creation of new exceptions. The danger of admitting
hearsay evidence is sufficient to admonish courts of justice against
lightly yielding to the introduction of fresh exceptions to an old and
well-established rule; the value of which is felt and acknowledged
by all.</p>

<p>If the circumstance that the eye-witnesses of any fact be dead
should justify the introduction of testimony to establish that fact,
from hearsay, no man could feel safe in any property, a claim to
which might be supported by proof so easily obtained.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.004.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.004.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/thumbnails/oscys.report.0002.002.004.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

<p>This subject was very ably discussed in the case of <span class="bibl case">The King against
the Inhabitants of Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707</span>, where the question related
to the fac1 that a pauper had gained a residence, a fact which it was
contended might be proved by hearsay evidence. In that case the
court was divided, but it was afterwards determined that the evidence
was inadmissible.</p>

<p>This court is of the same opinion.</p>

<p>The general rule comprehends the case, and the case is
not within any exception heretofore recognized. This
court is not inclined to extend the exceptions further than
they have already been carried.</p>

<p>There are other exceptions taken which appear on the record, bat
were not much relied upon in argument.</p>

<p>The third exception is to the qualification of one of the jurors.
He was called as a talesman, and was stated to be an inhabitant of
the county of Alexandria, not of Washington. The court decided
that he was a proper juryman, and he was sworn. After his being
sworn the objection was made by the plaintiff's counsel, and an exception
was taken to the opinion of the court.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the weight of this exception if taken
in time, the court cannot sustain it now. The exception ought to
have been made before the juror was sworn.</p>

<p>The fourth exception also applies to an opinion given by the circuit court, respecting the service of one of the persons summoned as
a juror. James Reed, when called, was questioned, and appeared to
have formed and expressed no opinion on the particular case; but on
being further questioned, he avowed his detestation of slavery to be
such that, in a doubtful case, he would find a verdict for the plaintiffs;
and that be bad so expressed himself with regard to this very cause.
He added, that if the testimony were equal, he should certainly find
a verdict for the plaintiffs. The court then instructed the tryers that
he did not stand indifferent between the parties. To this instruction
an exception was taken.</p>

<p>It is certainly much to be desired that jurors should enter upon
their duties with minds entirely free from every prejudice. Perhaps
on general and public questions it is scarcely possible to avoid receiving
some prepossessions, and where a private right depends on
such a question, the difficulty of obtaining jurors whose minds are
entirely uninfluenced by opinions previously formed is undoubtedly
considerable. Yet they ought to be superior to every exception,
they ought to stand perfectly indifferent between the parties; and
although the bias which was acknowledged in this case
might not perhaps have been so strong as to render it

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.005.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/large/oscys.report.0002.002.005.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="http://jetson.unl.edu/oscys_figures/thumbnails/oscys.report.0002.002.005.jpg" class="display"></img></a></span>

positively improper to allow the juror to be sworn on the jury, yet
it was desirable to submit the case to those who felt no bias either
way; and therefore the court exercised a sound discretion in not
permitting him to be sworn.</p>

<p>There is no error in the proceedings of the circuit court, and the
judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Duvall, J. The principal point in this case is upon the admissibility
of hearsay evidence. The court below admitted hearsay evidence
to prove the freedom of the ancestor from whom the petitioners
claim, but refused to admit hearsay of hearsay. This court has
decided that hearsay evidence is not admissible to prove that the ancestor
from whom they claim was free. From this opinion I dissent.</p>

<p>In Maryland, the law bas been for many years settled, that on a
petition for freedom, where the petitioner claims from an ancestor
who has been dead for a great length of time, the issue may be
proved by hearsay evidence, if the fact is of such antiquity that
living testimony cannot be procured. Such was the opinion of the
judges of the general court of Maryland, and their decision was
affirmed by the unanimous opinion of the judges of the high court
of appeals in the last resort, after full argument by the ablest counsel
at the bar. I think the decision was correct. Hearsay evidence was
admitted upon the same principle, upon which it is admitted to prove
a custom, pedigree, and the boundaries of land; because, from the
antiquity of the transactions to which these subjects may have reference,
it is impossible to produce living testimony. To exclude hearsay
in such cases, would leave the party interested without remedy.
It was decided also that the issue could not be prejudiced by the
neglect or omission of the ancestor. If the ancestor neglected to
claim her right, the issue could not be bound by length of time, it
being a natural inherent right. It appears to me that the reason for
admitting hearsay evidence upon a. question of freedom is much
stronger than in cases of pedigree, or in controversies relative
to the boundaries of land. It will be universally admitted
 that the right to freedom is more important than the
right of property.</p>

<p>And people of color, from their helpless condition under the uncontrolled authority of a master, are entitled to all reasonable protection.
A decision that hearsay evidence in such cases shall not be admitted,
cuts up by the roots all claims of the kind, and puts a final end to
them, unless the claim should arise from a fact of recent date, and
such a case will seldom, perhaps never, occur.</p>
