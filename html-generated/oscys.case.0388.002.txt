         <p>Augustus Wynkoop of the city of New York merchant being duly sworn deposeth &amp; saith that in or about the fall of the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eleven he purchased from Thomas Butler of Richmond County in the State of New York the time of a negro boy named William then about the age of seven years, which said William being born since the fourth day of July one thousand and seven hundred and ninety nine was by the Laws of the State of New York free, but subject to remain the Servant of the owner of his mother in the same manner as if bound to service until the age of twenty eight years. That Deponent only received from said Butler a title to the services of the said William until he should arrive at the said age of twenty eight years. That Deponent on the thirty first Day of May last transferred his right to the said Boy to one George W Lewis of the State of New Jersey, a Physician by profession as deponent understood, that it was well understood by said Lewis at the time of such transfer that the said William was not a slave but only liable to serve until of the age aforesaid. That this fact was expressly stated by Deponent to said Lewis, and a memorandum thereof made on the deed of transfer from Deponent to said Lewis. That Deponent has since understood that the said Lewis has

since sold the said William as a Slave in the State of Virginia. That from an official certificate <span class="unclear illegible">handed[?]</span> to Deponent by said Thomas Butler at the time of the purchase by this Deponent it appeared that said William was born on or about the twenty fifth day of December one thousand eight hundred and four. And that the said certificate was handed over to said Lewis by Deponent along with the Deed of Transfer made by said Deponent to said Lewis</p>

         <p>State of New York ss: I John Nitchie a Public Notary of the State of New York residing in the City of New York do hereby certify that by the Seventh section of the Act of the Legislature of the State of New York entitled "An Act concerning slaves &amp; servants" - passed April 9th 1813, it is enacted "that every Child born of a slave within this State after the fourth day of July one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine, shall be free, but shall remain the servant of the owner of his mother and the Executors or Administrators of such owner, in the same manner as if such child had been bound to service by the

And does further certify that the said Law of 1813 is one of the revised laws of said States and that the same provision was contained in the antecedent law of the state, under the existence of which the said negroe Boy was born. In Testimony whereof I have hereunto subscribed my hand and affixed my seal of office this thirteenth day of June 1816.</p>
