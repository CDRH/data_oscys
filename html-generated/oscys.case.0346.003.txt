Her Master learning that she had a free husband in Washington, and that she wished to live with him, agreed that if he could raise $400 for him that <del>she</del> he should have her <del>freedom</del> That the money never was raised, nor any portion of it ever paid to him.</p>

         <p>Upon this evidence the Counsel for the deft. prayd the Court to instruct the Jury that if they believed the same to be true, that they ought to find their verdict for the defendant.</p>

         <p>(refused)</p>
