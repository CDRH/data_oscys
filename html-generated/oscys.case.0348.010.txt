whom he owned a short time.</p>

         <p>Inter 3rd. How old was Lotty at the time James Condon first got possession of her; and how old was she when Condon left this County?</p>

         <p>Ans: When I went to live with James Condon I found in his family negro Lotty and I do not know how long she had previously lived there. When Condon left this State Lotty was <del>about</del> between fourteen and sixteen.</p>

         <p>Inter 4th Do you know from whom and in what manner James Condon became possessed of negro Lotty?</p>

         <p>Ans: I have always understood and believed that she was purchased of Daniel Parker; for what time I know not.</p>

         <p>Ans: I know nothing which will avail in the prosecution of her suit. While in Condon's family I <del>have</del> frequently heard Mrs: Condon say, at times when a little provoked with Lotty's conduct, that she (Lotty) should not be free so soon as Lotty expected. I have also heard in Condons family that Lotty was promised her freedom; whether by James Condon, his wife, or Daniel Parker I do not know.</p>

         <p>Ans: It was a fact notorious that Condon was about to leave this state and carry with him negro Lotty; and I heard no objection at that time nor since, till the institution of the present suit.</p>

         <p>In: 1st Did you ever know James Condon formerly of Dorchester County; if yea, when and how long?</p>

         <p>Ans: I did know him from the year seventeen hundred and ninety seven till the spring of eighteen hundred and five: when he left the state.</p>

         <p>Intr: 2nd During this lapse of time had Condon any slave or slaves in his family or elsewhere?</p>

         <p>Ans: During this time I lived under the same roof with Condon and he had no slave except negro Lotty who lived in his family.</p>

         <p>Intr: 3rd How old was Lotty when Condon left here for the Western County?</p>

         <p>Ans: She was about eighteen years old. I knew her well she was grown to a woman some years before he left the state.</p>

Lotty?</p>

         <p>Ans: James Condon purchased her of Daniel Parker as a slave for life. I will recollect that she was purchased a slave for life and at a price at that time considered high.</p>

         <p>Intr: 5th At the time Condon left here did he go off privately or was that fact known?</p>

         <p>Ans: It was known six months before he left here that he intended to go to the western county and it was also known by all persons that he intended to take with him negro Lotty.</p>

         <p>Intr: 6th Was there not at the time several members of the Abolition Society living in and about Cambridge and did they not know that he intended to leave the state and cary with him negro Lotty and did any one of them make any effort to arrest her going?</p>

         <p>Ans: There were several members of that society living in and about Cambridge and I presume they, as well others, knew that he intended to carry with him negro Lotty, and I never heard that she was not a slave for life till the institution of this suit. I am entirely certain that James Condon purchased Lotty a slave for life</p>
