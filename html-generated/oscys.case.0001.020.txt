         <p>To the Honble the Judges of <del>Was</del> the Circuit Court for the County of Washington in the District of Columbia</p>

      <div class="body">
     
         <p>The Petition of Ben (a man of colour) humbly sheweth that he has filed a Petition in the Court for his freedom against a certain Sabritt Scott, &amp; that a subpoena has been issued thereon &amp; he believes served on the said Scott, returnable to the next December Term of this Court. Your Petitioner further states that he seriously apprehends that before the return of said subpoena &amp; before said Scott can be compelled under it to enter into the usual &amp; proper recognizance, he may be removed by secret &amp; unjustifiable means without the Jurisdiction of this honorable Court. Your Petitioner being still held in the possession of said Scott &amp; the said Scott owning &amp; trading with vessels to the West Indies &amp; other places, &amp; your Petitioner being one of his Mariners, he fears that the means of removing him being so obvious &amp; easy the said Scott will avail himself of them.</p>

         <p>Your Petitioner therefore begs that this honorable Court will interfere <del>the prevent</del> that said Scott may be compelled by a subpoena to appear &amp; recognize with security in the usual manner, or that subpoenas may issue to compell the attendance of witnesses to prove that his grounds of apprehension are reasonable.</p>

         <p>And your Petitioner will pray</p>

         <p>F S Key for Petr.</p>
