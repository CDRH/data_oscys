         Case Narrative
         
         <p>Ben was a "mariner" held in slavery by Sabret Scott, a ship owner and merchant trader
            based in Washington, D.C. with extensive ties to the West Indies. Francis Scott Key
            represented Ben in his petition for freedom against Sabret Scott. Key filed the petition
            in September 1806 and argued that Ben "a man of colour" was sold and brought into
            Maryland in violation of the 
            <div class="bibl code">1796 Maryland Act </div> banning the importation of slaves into the state. Ben won his case at trial on June
            19, 1807, and he was declared free. The defendant filed a writ of error and 
            <em>supersedeas</em> to delay the judgment. But apparently the writ of error was never sent to the plaintiff.
            Taking his freedom, Ben left Sabret Scott. Then, sometime in early 1808 Scott claimed
            Ben was a runaway slave and had Ben arrested and held in the D.C. jail. Francis Scott
            Key filed a writ of habeas corpus in June 1809 and argued that because the defendants
            had not provided a copy of the writ of error Ben was free and could not be held. In
            December 1808 the D. C. Circuit Court could not reach a decision on the matter and
            kept Ben imprisoned. Finally, in the June 1809 term the court discharged Ben, finding
            that the defendants did not file a proper writ of error and provide a copy for the
            adverse party. The defendant's writ of error went to the Supreme Court of the United
            States in April 1810 and the Supreme Court overturned the D.C. Circuit Court and ordered
            a new trial. The case came back to trial in the D.C. Circuit Court in June 1811, nearly
            five years after Ben filed his petition for freedom

         <p>A 
            <em>supersedeas</em> is a defendant's appeal bond that a court requires from an appellant who wants to
            delay the payment of a judgment until the appeal is complete. William Blackstone,
            in 
            <div class="bibl treatise">Commentaries Vol. 3 </div>, notes that "before granting any appeal, writ of error, or 
            <em>supersedeas</em>, the appellant must enter into bond with security to pay the amount of the debt,
            and all costs and damages . . . in case the judgment be affirmed." (409) In this case
            Sabret Scott and George W. Riggs put up the surety bond of $1,000 paid to Ben. Sabret
            Scott signed the bond with an "x" indicating that despite his business ties and slaveholding
            he was illiterate.
