            of the counsel for the said Petitioner and being duly sworn saith that the said Defendant
            Allison Naylor did during the last term of this Honorable Court refuse permission
            to the said Petitioner through this Deponent to attend to her said suit except the
            liberty of attending court on the day of trials of this said cause and that during

            informed and believes that neither of her other counsel Messrs Cox and Carlisle has
            seen this said Petitioner in the last mentioned period and this Deponent has reason
            to believe and does believe that the said Defendant has prohibited and prevented the
            said Petitioner from consulting her said Counsel or either of them during this time
            about the said suit and attending to the same exept as aforesaid
