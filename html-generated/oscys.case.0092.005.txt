         <p>The defts insisted  &amp; contended before the Jury, 1st. that the facts given in Evidence as aforesaid do not impose upon the defts the necessity of proving by substantive evidence that the said James Craik had taken the oath prescribed by the <span class="bibl code">act of the Genl. Assembly of Virginia passed in the year 1785. ch. 77</span>, within the time prescribed by that act: and that the jury, upon the said state of facts, ought not to find for the petitioners, for the want of such substantive process on the part of the defts.</p>
