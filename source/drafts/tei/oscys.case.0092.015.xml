<pb xml:id="p005" facs="oscys.case.0092.015.005.jpg"/>

1792 and before the month of December in that year, James
Craik removed from the State of Maryland into the County of 
Fairfax in the <del>County of Fairf</del> Commonwealth of Virginia with
intent to settle in said County and become a Citizen of said

continue to reside as such in said County till his death; which
happened some time in the year 1814. that said Craik at the
time of his said removal brought the Petitioner Matilda with 
him from Maryland aforesaid into the County aforesaid she being
then a Negro slave belonging to said Craik; and continually held the
said Petitioner and her children in said County as slaves till his death 
and at his death devised them as slaves to his widow: who some
time in the year 1814 removed from said County of Fairfax into the
Town and County of Alexandria in this District bringing with her
the said Petitioners and holding them as slaves in said Town
of Alexandria till her death which happened some time in the 
year 1815 and at her death <sic>demised</sic> the said Petitioner to Ann the
late wife of the Defendant Moore, and to Louisa the late wife of the
Defendant Mason by her last will hereto annexed; that the said Ann
and Louisa were at the time of such demise for a long time before and
ever after till their respective deaths, inhabitants of the District of
Columbia; the said Ann of Alexandria aforesaid and the said Louisa
of George Town in the County of Washington: That the said Defendants
Mason and Moore were at the time of their respective inter<del>rogatories</del><add>marriage</add> with
said Ann and Louisa for a long time before and ever since inhabitants and
Citizens of said District the said Moore of Alexandria aforesaid, the said
Mason of George Town aforesaid: That the said Petitioners were kept
in Alexandria aforesaid for the space of Eighteen months after

<pb xml:id="p006" facs="oscys.case.0092.015.006.jpg"/>

Twenty Years: And it is admitted that at the time of the said removal
of the said Craik from Maryland into Fairfax as aforesaid and 
during all the year 1792 there were only Nineteen Magistrates in
Commission as Justices of the <del>Peace</del> said County of Fairfax; all of
whom have since departed this life. The last survivor of them having

<p>And upon the facts so given in evidence and admitted as aforesaid
the Petitioners prayed the opinion of the Court and an instruction 
to the Jury. That if the Defendant wishes to avail himself of the
benefit of the provisos in the &#160;&#160; sect of the Act of &#160;&#160;&#160;
it is incumbent on him to produce competent testimony to prove that
the said &#160;&#160; Craik had complied with the terms and conditions
of the said proviso, and that in the absence of all testimony no
presumption can arise from lapse of time or other facts in the
case agreed to supply the defect of sworn testimony which opinion
and instruction was accordingly given by the Court to the Jury: to which
opinion and instruction the Defendants by their counsel except and
thereupon the Defendants insisted and contended, before the Jury;
first that the facts, given in evidence as aforesaid, do not impose
upon the Defendants the necessity of proving by substantive evidence,
that the said James Craik had taken the Oath prescribed by the
Act of General Assembly of Virginia passed in the year 1787
ch. 77, within the time prescribed by the Act: and that the Jury
upon the said statement of facts ought not to find the petitioners,
for the want of such substantive proofs on the part of the Defendants.
2dly. That the Jury, under the circumstances so given in evidence,
may presume that the said James Craik had taken the said
Oath in the prescribed time. But the Court, upon the
motion of the Petitioners overruled all the points so insisted upon
and contended for by the Defendants and stopped the Defendants
Counsel from proceeding to maintain the points or any of the
points so insisted upon and contended for before the Jury by
the Defendants. To which opinion and instruction the
