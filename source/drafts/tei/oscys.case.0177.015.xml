<p>Petition
to Ch. Justice
U.S.
for 
Writ of 
Error</p>
<p>To the Honorable Roger B. Taney Chief
Justice of the United States.</p>
<p>The petition of James Rhodes of Washington
County in the District of Columbia respectfully
sheweth, that at March <unclear></unclear> 1842 of the
Circuit Court of the District of Columbia in and
for Washington County, a certain Moses Bell (colored)
by judgment of said Court, recovered his
freedom against your petitioner who then held &amp;
still holds said Moses Bell as his lawful slave
as will more fully appear by the record of the proceedings
in said cause herewith exhibited as part of
this petition. </p>
<p>Your petitioner sheweth that he
is aggrieved by said judgment and he prays that
an order may be passed by your Honor directing
a writ of Error to be issued by the Clerk of said
Court for the County of Washington, according to the
Act of Congress entitled "An Act to limit the
right of appeal from the Circuit Court of <del>for</del> the United
States for the District of Columbia." Approved 
2nd April 1810. Otherwise your petitioner will 
loose the benefit of all appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States, as the matter in
Controversy is less in value than one thousand
dollars, though exceeding in value the sum of 
one hundred dollars exclusive of costs, and he
refers to the subjoined assignment of errors as
part of this petition, and your petitioner as
in duty will every pray.</p>

attorneys</p>

<p>3</p>
<p>Assignment of Errors in the judgment
referred to in the aforegoing petition</p>
<p>Assg. of Errors</p>
<p>1st. There is Error because the removal of
Moses Bell from Alexandria County to Washington
County in the District of Columbia, as
stated in the Special verdict, did not entitle
him to his freedom under any law in <unclear reason= "illegible" >free</unclear> in
said District.</p>
<p>2nd. Moses Bell being over 45 years of age
at the time of such removal was incapable
by the laws in <unclear reason= "illegible" >free</unclear> in said <del>District</del> Washington
County of receiving his freedom by or 
through any act or acts of his master or
owner.</p>
<p>3d. That said removal of Moses Bell is
not an <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> according to the true
intent and meaning of the laws in <unclear reason= "illegible" >free</unclear>
in Washington County aforesaid.</p>
<p>See case of Bk.Alex vs Dyer
decided by Sep. 6 within last 4 years.</p>
<p>4th. That such removal even if it would have 
been illegal previous to the year 1812, was
legalised and allowed by Act of Congress
of the 24th June 1812.</p>
<p>Dec 8 Peters. 12.49 which show how
unsettled the law is on these points
and how desirable a decision in for
citizens of the District, whose daily 
transactions may be within the operation
of these principles.</p>

<pb xml:id="p006" facs="IMG_3937.jpg"/>
<p>4</p>
<p>Thereupon the Honorable Chief Justice
made the following order to wit:</p>
<p>Ordered that the Writ of Error be
issued according to the prayer of the within
petition.</p>
<p>R.B. Taney
Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court
of the U. States
Dec. 13 1842</p>
<p>To William Brent Clerk
of the Circuit Court
for Washington County in
the District of Columbia</p>
<p>Writ of Error</p>
<p>Thereupon the following Writ of Error 
issued as ordered to wit:
The United States of America,
To the Judges of the Circuit
Court of the District of Columbia, sitting for
the County of Washington. Greeting:</p>
<p>Because in the record and proceedings 
as also in the inditing of the judgment of a
plea which is in the said Court before you
or some of you between Moses Bell plaintiff
and James Rhodes, defendant. A manifest
error hath happened to the great damage of
<pb xml:id="p007" facs="IMG_3940.jpg"/>
of the said defendant, as by his complaint
appears. We being willing that error if any
hath been, should be duly corrected, and full
and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid
in this behalf do command you if judgment
be therein given, that under your hand distinctly 
and openly you send the record and
proceedings aforesaid, with all the things concerning
the same to the Supreme Court of the
United States together with this writ, so that 
you have the same at Washington on the second
Monday of January next, in the said Supreme 
Court to be then and there held, and that the
record and proceedings aforesaid being inspected
the said Supreme Court may cause further to
be done therein to cancel that error, which
of right, and according to the laws, and 
customs of the United States should be done.</p>
<p>Witness the Honorable Roger B. Taney
Chief Justice of said Supreme Court</p>
<p>Issued this 16th day of Dec. 1842</p>
<p>W. Brent Clk</p>

<p>District of Maryland to wit</p>
<p>The United States of America
To Moses Bell Greeting:</p>
<p>You are hereby cited and admonished to be and
appear at a Supreme Court of the United States
on the Second Monday of January next, pursuant 
to Writ of Error filed in the Clerk's
office of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Columbia in the
County of Washington, wherein James
Rhodes is Plaintiff in Error and you are Defendant 
in Error to show cause if any
there be, why judgement rendered against the
said James Rhodes, Plaintiff in Error, should
it be corrected, and why speedy justice
would not be done to the parties in this behalf.</p>

day of December 1842</p>
