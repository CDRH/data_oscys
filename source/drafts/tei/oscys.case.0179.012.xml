<p>To the Honorable Chief Justice Taney.</p>
 
<p>The Petition of Richard B. Alexander humbly represents that at March Term 1840 of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, for the County of Washington, on a petition for freedom filed by Moses Graham against the said Richard B. Alexander, complaining of illegal detention in Slavery, judgment was rendered for the said Richard B. Alexander, but not as full and complete a judgment as ought in law have been rendered in the case, as will more fully appear by a copy of the record and proceedings in the said cause and hereto annexed.</p>
 
<p>And the said Richard B. Alexander assigns error as follows:</p>
 
<p>The first fact the Jury find in the Special Verdict (bearing on the point in error) is, "that Miss Brown sold Milly and her two children to Mrs Alexander. She to be free at 31 and her children then born and then afterwords to be born at the same age" They further find that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age" Upon a reference, however, to the will of Miss Brown (in the Transcript of the proceedings) it will be found that the petitioner (Moses

<pb xml:id="p004" facs="IMG_3855.jpg"/>

Graham) is not mentioned or referred to, is not emancipated by any possibility of construction which the Court could, by law, give to the instrument.</p>
 
<p>Now the error assigned by the Defendant is in the erroneous application of the law to the above facts. The law of Virginia 1792 Chap: 103 Section 36 (and applicable to this case) provides that Slaves shall be emancipated either by last will and testament or by deed recorded in the County or Corporation Court. Any other method of emancipation is void.</p>
 
<p>As such is the law, the fact found by the Jury that "Milly" (Mother of the petitioner) "and her children, were sold to Mrs Alexander to be free as they should respectively arrive at the age of 31 years" does not amount to such an emancipation as the law requires. The fact found by the Jury that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age" is an encroachment on province of the Court, whose duty it is to decide as to the import and construction of last wills and testaments. It will be found upon a reference to this will that the Petitioner (Moses) is not mentioned in such will, is not referred to by the testatrix, that there
 
<pb xml:id="p005" facs="IMG_3856.jpg"/>

is not the remotest implication by which his freedom can be effected.</p>
 
<p>Notwithstanding the said will does not emancipate the petitioner, and although the law peremptorily requires the emancipation to be by deed or last will and testament, the Court, gives to the petitioner his freedom at the age of 31 years.</p>
 
<p>The error above assigned involves a question of law of extensive interest, both public and private– of a public interest, since it admits the reception of parol evidence to explain and enlarge the meaning of a will, to give to a last will and testament a different meaning from that which the words in themselves evidently and necessarily imply,– of a private interest to the Defendant, since there are several other Slaves having similar claims, in whose favour similar verdicts would be found, and which verdicts would be construed by the Court, as having a similar legal effect and operation, unless the Supreme Court shall reverse so errorneous a decision.</p>

<p>Wherefore your petitioner prays that your Honor will issue an order to the Clerk of the said Court directing him to issue a writ of error under the terms and conditions
 
<pb xml:id="p006" facs="IMG_3858.jpg"/>

prescribed by law in all such cases. and as in duty bound he will ever pray</p>

<p>Swann &amp; Swann<lb/> 
Attorneys</p>

<p>On the back of the aforegoing petition was the following Order to wit:</p> 

<p>I have read and considered the within petition of Richard B. Alexander, the Defendant in the within mentioned case, and also the proceedings of the Circuit Court therein referred to, and complained of by the Petitioner, a copy of which proceedings accompanies this petition, and being of Opinion that the errors assigned and relied on involve questions of law of such extensive interest and operation, as to render the final decision of them by the Supreme Court desirable, I do hereby direct the Clerk of Washington County to issue the writ of error as prayed for, upon the terms and conditions in such cases presented by law</p>
 
<p>R. B. Taney</p>

<p>Whereupon in pursuance of the above order a writ of error issued, and a citation, directed to the said Moses Graham as follows to wit:</p>

<pb xml:id="p007" facs="IMG_3861.jpg"/>

<p>The United States of America, Ss:</p> 

<p>The President of the United States.– To the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, sitting for the County of Washington– Greetings</p>

<p>Because in the record and proceedings as also in the rendition of the judgment of a plea which is in the said Court before you as some of you, between Moses Graham, plaintiff, and Richard B. Alexander defendant: a manifest error hath happened, to the great damage of the said Richard B. Alexander, as by his complaint appears. We being willing, that error, if any hath been, should be duly corrected, and full and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid in this behalf, do command you if judgment be therein given, that, under your seal distinctly and openly you send, the record and proceedings aforesaid, with all things concerning the same to the Supreme Court of the United States together with this writ, so that you have the same at Washington <del>on the second monday in January next</del> in said Supreme Court now sitting <del>to be then and there held</del> and that the record and proceedings aforesaid, being inspected, the said Supreme Court may cause further to be done therein to that error, which of right, and according to the law &amp; custom of the United States should be done.</p>

<p>her sister Mrs. Alexander in Alexandria Country- that during all this time the petitioners mother and grandmother belonged to Miss. Brown who some time about the year 1873, while she was living with Mrs. Alexander brought Milly from Washington County where she had been <gap>strikethrough residing</gap> living, hired out by her mistress for one or two years to Mrs. Alexander, in Alexandria County.</p>
<p>That Milly then had two female children and that the petitioner was born afterwards and while Milly was at Mrs. Alexanders, that Mrs. Brown on brining her to Mrs. Alexander's sold Milly and her two children to Mrs. Alexander, she to be free at 31 and her children then born and those afterwards to be born at the same age.</p>
<p>That the petitioner was held by Mrs. Alexander during her life, and by her administrator the present defendant since, not as a slave for life, but as entitled to freedom at 31 years of age.</p>
<p>That Miss. Brown died in 1825 making her last will and testament (copied in page 20.)</p>
<p>That Miss. Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of said negroes to her sister to be, that they were to be free at 31 years of age-</p>
<p>Ant that the petitioner will be on the 25th of Dec. 1839 twenty six years of age.</p>
