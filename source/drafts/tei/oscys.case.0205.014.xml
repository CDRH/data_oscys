<p>Petitin reffered to in page 7 as marked B.</p>
<p>Rachael Wallingsford vs Joseph Wallingsford</p>
<p> The petition of Joseph Wallingsford Humbly represents to the Hon. Judges of the County Court of Prince Georges Country that great injustice has been done him by the interlocutory order passed in this cause at the October term of your honorable Court in 1825 in consequence of your Orator not having it in power at that time to show unto your honor the amount of his property and the extent to which he was able to pay for the separate maintenance of his wife. </p>
<p>Your Orator will state to your honors that it will be utterly unpossible for him to pay at the rate of $120. Per annum for the support of his wife without selling property every year for</p>
<pb xml:id="p014" facs="IMG_3764.jpg"/>
<p> that purpose in as much as the whole nett product of his own labour and of all of the property which he was in profession will not amount annually to near that sum, for he was only on  a small plantation of poor land and two old Negroes the one an old man upwards of 60 years old with the other a woman upwards of 50 with a few horses and cattle and other small stock assist him in labor to procure a subsistence; after feeding and clothing himself and family that he has living with him, which he is bound by law and religion to support he is satisfied that all the other proceeds of his labor, land and other property could upon an average in the present times exceed $        Your Orator would further state that it is not true as alleged in the petition of the said complaint that he treated his said wife ill or drove her out of his house or <del>home</del> kept any other woman either white or black or yellow or of any other colour unlawfully or improperly in his house or family to the annoyance of his said wife but that his said wife became discontented and refused to live with him any longer and went off and left his bed and board without knowledge and entirely of her own will that after she  had thus gone off he went to see her and told her that he wished her to come back and live with him and that if she would come back again and live with him nobody should interfere with her which she pointedly refused to do</p>
<pb xml:id="p015" facs="IMG_3765.jpg"/>
<p>saying that she would not to save his life, that at the time when his said wife went away she carried with her without his consent or knowledge a Negro girl about 12 years old the property of your Orator, that afterwords finding his said wife was determined to live apart from him, at her own request and by her express agreement he agreed to give her a certain sum of money, in property and cash for her future separate support amounting as your Orator believes $900. or thereabouts which she alledged that she ha dbrought with her by her marriage consisting of the aforesaid Negro Girl, $75 cash, a bed, a horse five head of cattle, 200 weight of bacon &amp; Sundry other small articles of house hold and kitchen furniture, one single bill for $125 and <add>one</add>other for 200$ amounting altogether to the aforesaid $900. Which she agreed to take as placing her in the same situation in which she was before said marriage and thereupon to aquit and discharge your Orator from all further claim upon him for support, and your Orator avers that he did actually deliver all the aforesaid money notes and property to her in pursuance of said agreement and that she carried all away, your Orator further states that after the expiration of about two years as nearly as he can now recollect his said wife became dissatisfied with her </p>
<pb xml:id="p016" facs="IMG_3769.jpg"/>
<p> situation and returned to his house for about three weeks would stay about two or three days at a time and go away and return and pass her time partly with your Orator and partly away after which she became offended because your Orator did not pay the aforesaid single bills, which you Orator delayed paying because he was informed and believed that he intended as soon as she should to get the money for those bills to bring a suit against him, she brought suit against your Orator in your honourable Court for a separate maintenance, the circumstances of which suit your Honors are already acquainted with as they appear upon record of your Honorable court which you can refer to, that upon you Orator being brought into you Honorable Court by an attachment he was alarmed and in that situation agreed to give his wife the sum of $2000. Including the property formerly given to her, that he might be forever rid of the necessity of supporting his said wife and being harassed by her, this however  your Orator found would be ro him what would amount to his utter ruin; whereupon advised with counsel</p>
