<p>Defts. Petition in Prince Georgia County Court</p>
<p>Petition referred to in page 7 as marked B.</p>
<p>Rachael Wallingsford vs Joseph Wallingsford</p>
<p> The petition of Joseph Wallingsford Humbly represents to the Hon. Judges of the County Court of Prince Georges Country that great injustice has been done him by the interlocutory order passed in this cause at the October term of your honorable Court in 1825 in consequence of your Orator not having it in power at that time to show unto your honor the amount of his property and the extent to which he was able to pay for the separate maintenance of his wife. </p>
<p>Your Orator will state to your honors that it will be utterly unpossible for him to pay at the rate of $120. Per annum for the support of his wife without selling property every year for</p>
<pb xml:id="p014" facs="IMG_3764.jpg"/>
<p> that purpose in as much as the whole nett product of his own labour and of all of the property which he was in profession will not amount annually to near that sum, for he was only on  a small plantation of poor land and two old Negroes the one an old man upwards of 60 years old with the other a woman upwards of 50 with a few horses and cattle and other small stock assist him in labor to procure a subsistence; after feeding and clothing himself and family that he has living with him, which he is bound by law and religion to support he is satisfied that all the other proceeds of his labor, land and other property could upon an average in the present times exceed $        Your Orator would further state that it is not true as alleged in the petition of the said complaint that he treated his said wife ill or drove her out of his house or <del>home</del> kept any other woman either white or black or yellow or of any other colour unlawfully or improperly in his house or family to the annoyance of his said wife but that his said wife became discontented and refused to live with him any longer and went off and left his bed and board without knowledge and entirely of her own will that after she  had thus gone off he went to see her and told her that he wished her to come back and live with him and that if she would come back again and live with him nobody should interfere with her which she pointedly refused to do</p>
<pb xml:id="p015" facs="IMG_3765.jpg"/>
<p>saying that she would not to save his life, that at the time when his said wife went away she carried with her without his consent or knowledge a Negro girl about 12 years old the property of your Orator, that afterwords finding his said wife was determined to live apart from him, at her own request and by her express agreement he agreed to give her a certain sum of money, in property and cash for her future separate support amounting as your Orator believes $900. or thereabouts which she alleged that she had brought with her by her marriage consisting of the aforesaid Negro Girl, $75 cash, a bed, a horse five head of cattle, 200 weight of bacon &amp; Sundry other small articles of house hold and kitchen furniture, one single bill for $125 and <add>one</add>other for 200$ amounting altogether to the aforesaid $900. Which she agreed to take as placing her in the same situation in which she was before said marriage and thereupon to acquit and discharge your Orator from all further claim upon him for support, and your Orator avers that he did actually deliver all the aforesaid money notes and property to her in pursuance of said agreement and that she carried all away, your Orator further states that after the expiration of about two years as nearly as he can now recollect his said wife became dissatisfied with her </p>
<pb xml:id="p016" facs="IMG_3769.jpg"/>
<p> situation and returned to his house for about three weeks would stay about two or three days at a time and go away and return and pass her time partly with your Orator and partly away after which she became offended because your Orator did not pay the aforesaid single bills, which you Orator delayed paying because he was informed and believed that he intended as soon as she should to get the money for those bills to bring a suit against him, she brought suit against your Orator in your honourable Court for a separate maintenance, the circumstances of which suit your Honors are already acquainted with as they appear upon record of your Honorable court which you can refer to, that upon you Orator being brought into you Honorable Court by an attachment he was alarmed and in that situation agreed to give his wife the sum of $2000. Including the property formerly given to her, that he might be forever rid of the necessity of supporting his said wife and being harassed by her, this however  your Orator found would be to him what would amount to his utter ruin; whereupon advised with counsel learned in the law who told him that what had been done in relation to the said suit could not be binding upon him in as much as his said wife was not found thereby </p>
<pb xml:id="p017" facs="IMG_3770.jpg"/>
<p> and might still thereafter come upon him for a support if she should waste that property and again become indigent.</p>
<p>Whereupon he determined to appeal from the decree of your humors in said suit for maintenance and accordingly did so with the effect of the said decree having been reversed by the Court of Appeal, your Orator will further state that upon the said information having been given him he did forthwith come to the  conclusion that his said wife should not live apart from him if he could help it as he could not hesitate in the choice to submit to her complaints and discomfort and whatever other annoyance he might be subjected to by the acerbity of her temper rather than submit to utter ruin as he had a numerous offspring  and was old himself and getting to be infirm and approaching the age of helplessness and infirmity. That thereupon he went to his said wife and requested her to go home and live with him, promising to be as kind to her as possible and to protect and maintain her at home and urging the necessity of her going home as it was utterly out of his power to afford her separate maintenance as it was with the utmost difficulty, that he could support his family at home and assuring her that she should not be interfered with by any body. That nevertheless his said wife positively</p>
<pb xml:id="p018" facs="IMG_3772.jpg"/>
<p>refused to go home with him, or to live with him on any terms. That thereupon he publicly advertised in a newspaper in the City of Washington the National Intelligence, that his wife had left him and that he forbid all person from harbouring her in the hope that she would thus be driven to the necessity of returning home to live with him, which she however still persisted in refusing to  do, your Orator further states that when he afterwards heard of the reversal of the said Decree of your  honors and was informed by his Counsel that he was thereby restored to all his natural rights he again called upon his said wife and requested her to come live with him promising her again protection and kindness which she still refused to do and on the contrary at the next term of your Hon. Court thereafter filed another petition in your Honb. Court praying for alimony your Orator, should pay to his said wife $120 . Per Annum quarterly during the pendencies of the said suit, your Orator will further state that he has almost reduced to win by the necessity of paying that annuity and that he can see no certain prospect of an end to that suit, that his said wife has still retained the said property which he gave to her by virtue of the said agreement and that the said Negro girl has now become a woman and has two children all of whom with the Mother are worth $450. That for the purpose of enabling </p>
<pb xml:id="p019" facs="IMG_3774.jpg"/>
<p>himself to pay the said $120. he went about 4 or 5 weeks ago to the city of Washington where his said wife keeps the said Negroes and took them in his possession, as he was advised he had a right to do and as he was directed by Judge Cranch before whom he was obliged to go before he could get full possession of them and was about to bring them away when his said wife finding the judgement of Judge Cranch, that he had a right to bring them away and use them as his own property, became greatly distressed &amp; offended and agreed that if your Orator would suffer the said Negroes Mother and children to remain with here she would on that account agree to never claim of him anything more in consequence of the said interlocutory Order, and that she would discontinue her suit for alimony and that each party should retain what they had and be quit forever after, which was assented to by your Orator who left the said woman and children with her as agreed upon but so it is may it please your honors that since that time she has still persisted in claiming the said allowance of $120. Per Annum and ordered the sheriff to execute your Orator therefor she still refusing to comply with the said agreement; all of which are oppressive, unjust, contrary to equity and good conscience, wherefore your Orator prays your Honors to suspend the execution of the said interlocutory order </p>
