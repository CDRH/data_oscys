<p>James Ash vs William H.Williams  Circuit  Court of the District of Columbia for the county of Washington Petition for Freedom.</p>
<p>Be it remembered that on the first day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty judgement by the said court was rendered against the Defendant in the above cause, as appears from the minutes and proceedings of said Court.</p>
<p>Whereupon the said defendant by John Marbury esquire his Attorney filed in court here the following petition, which appears to have been addressed to the Honorable Roger B Taney Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in the word &amp;off the <unclear></unclear> following to writ:</p>
<p>Petition to the Hon. R.B. Taney</p>
<p>To the Honorable the Ch. Justice of the United States</p>
<p>The petition of William H. Williams of Washington City in the District of Columbia respectfully shows. That in the month of December last he purchased from Gerrard T. Greenfield, a negro man named James Ash, with notice that the said Greenfield claimed the said negro under the will of Maria A. Greenfield late of Prince Georges County, Maryland, deceased, and that the said Maria had, by a proviso in her will restricted the <del><unclear></unclear></del> right of saw Gerrard to any one or to reserve him from the State of Maryland,a restriction</p>
<pb xml:id="p004" facs="IMG_3818.jpg"/>
<p>Which she in like manner impaled upon the said Gerard as legatee of sixteen other negroes in her said will. Your petitioner was also informed that the said Gerrard had been advised that such restriction upon the right to dispose of the property given him by the said will , being repugnant to the  nature of the estate given, was void, and that his object in selling the negro James Ash was to obtain a judicial decision on that question. the negro James was therefore informed of the sale and an opportunity  given him to commerce a suit for his freedom of the said negro. </p>
<p>Your petitioner further shows that the said negro James did commence his said suit and the same was tried as the term of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for Washington County <del></del> which closed its sittings on Friday the 1st of this month, and the judgement of the said court in said cause being against your petitioners be, finding himself aggrieved thereby, did pray an appeal, but in as much as the said negro is not of the value of one thousand dollars your petitioner cannot have the length of his appeal without an order from one of the justices of the Supreme Court <del></del> directing the same to be allowed. Your petitioner therefore believing that there is error in the judgement of the said Circuit Court in the said cause and that such error involves a question of law,</p>
<pb xml:id="p005" facs="IMG_3820.jpg"/>
<p>important to the slave sates, and therefore of such <del>important</del> extensive interest as to render a final decision of the same by the Supreme Court of the United States desirable respectfully lays before your hand a copy of the proceedings, complained of, and prays, that the same may be considered, and that your Hand would direct such order to the Clerk of the said Circuit Court as will enable your petitioners to reverse the said cause by appeal to the Supreme Court-the will pray-</p>
<p> And your petitioner asks leave to suggest the following as a sufficient cause why such order should be allowed.</p>
<p>That in the decision of the case of James Ash the Circuit Court have held virtually that the will of law which would have been applied in the trial often right to any other property inapplicable to a case in which the right of a negro to freedom was involved, it having been exceeded on all hands that if the request had related to other than negro property with a devise over in case of sale or removal the devise over would have been void as depending on a refulgent condition - on if Maria A. Greenfield had, instead of giving freedom to the negroes in the event of their being sold or received given them in such event to some third person that the devise over would have been void for the same reason.</p>
<p>In additon to which your petition may suggest that the value of the property</p>
<pb xml:id="p006" facs="IMG_3822.jpg"/>
<p>effected by the decision of James case is very <del></del> considerable as appears by the clause of the will under which he claims his freedom. he further begs leave to refer to the case of Bradley vs Piexote. 3 Vs:326</p>
