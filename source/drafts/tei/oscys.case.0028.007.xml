<div2 type="body">

<p>Mem. on the Trial of this cause the Petitioner
offered in evidence the deposition of Mrs Rankin
in these words (here insert it) and thereupon
prayed the Court to instruct the Jury that if they believe from the
evidence that the defendant knew of the intended importation of
the petitioner by Mrs Rankin and did not object to it, then
such importation by Mrs Rankin entitled the petitioner to her freedom
and further it is competent for the Jury to infer from his knowing
of the importation and not objecting to it that such importation

<pb xml:id="p006" facs="IMG_3631.jpg"/>

was made with his consent, which instruction the Court 
refused to give but instructed the Jury that if they should be of
opinion from the evidence that Mrs Rankin whose deposition
has been read in evidence as aforesaid was at the time she
brought the petitioner into the City of Washington as aforesaid
a citizen of the United States coming into the City of Washington
aforesaid with a bonafide intention of selling therein, then her
said importation of the said slave was lawful and did not
entitle the petitioner to her freedom, whether the said importation
were or were not made with the consent of the defendant</p>

<p>But that if the Jury should be of opinion
that the said Mrs Rankin was not a citizen of the United States
coming into the City of Washington with the intention of 
settling therein then such importation of the said slave was unlawful
and entitles the petitioner to her freedom whether such importation
were or were not with the consent of the defendant.</p>

<p>To the first branch of which instruction and the refusal of the 
prayer made by petitioners counsel the petitioner excepts
and to the second branch thereof the defendant excepts,
and this their joint and several bill of exceptions is signed
sealed and enrolled</p>

<pb xml:id="p007" facs="IMG_3633.jpg"/>

<p>the deposition mentioned in the aforegoing Bill of exceptions is as follows towit</p>

<p>Washington County District of Columbia Sct.</p>

<p>On this 3rd day of June before me the subscriber a Justice of the Peace
for the County and District aforesaid personally appeared Elizabeth K
Rankin &amp; being sworn in due form of Law deposed &amp; said that a negro
girl named Sally then quite a child was a short time before the
month of May 1810 put to live as a matter of favor with the deponent
then on a visit to Virginia where this deponent lived on said visit for
two years with the mother, by Mr. Henry W Ball who also resided 
at that time in Fairfax County Virginia where the said negro girl
was about nine miles from Washington That in consideration of the
services of the girl this deponent was to furnish the girl with victual
and cloaths &amp; that this deponent was to keep the girl for a year
but no particular bargain was made between Mr Ball &amp; the
deponent about the girl. That some time in the month of May
in the year 1810, this deponent removed to the City of Washington
from Virginia &amp; brought the said girl Sally with her Mr. Henry
W Ball being as this deponent thinks in Northumberland County
in Virginia at the time of this deponents removal to Washington.</p>

<p>Quest. Did you ever ask or obtain permission of Mr Ball to
remove Sally to Washington?</p> 

<p>Ans. I cannot recollect but
Mr Ball was frequently in the habit of coming to our house &amp; probably
heard of our intention to remove to Washington. But I do not
know whether he was ever asked or gave permission for the removal
of Sally.</p> 

<p>At the time of our removal Mr Ball was to the
best of my recollection in Northumberland County Virginia &amp;
had gone there sometime before our removal.</p>

<pb xml:id="p008" facs="IMG_3634.jpg"/>

<p>Quest. Did you not after your removal to Washington frequently
pass backwards &amp; forwards to &amp; from Virginia &amp; generally carry
Sally with you.</p> 

<p>Ans. I did in several instances pass
to &amp; from Virginia to Washington &amp; generally carried Sally with
me, &amp; on these visits to Virginia sometimes stayed a week or ten
days.</p>

<p>Sally once ran away from me while here &amp;
went over to Virginia where the deponent sent after her.</p>

<p>Quest. How long did Sally remain with you in Washington &amp; who
took her away.</p>

<p>Ans. Sally remained with me until after Mr
Ball married which was in October 1810. (having remained
with me seven or eight months, short time after his marriage
Mr Ball took her away &amp; carried her to Virginia, the deponent 
conceiving herself bound to give her up to Mr Ball whenever
he called for her.</p>

<p>Questions on the part of the petitioner–</p>

<p>1st Did or did not Mr Henry W Ball to the best of your knowledge
and belief know of your intention to return to the City of Washington
and to bring Sally with you?</p> 

<p>Answers she cannot say positively but she rather imagines he did.</p>

<p>2nd Did or did not Mr Ball shortly after you had brought
Sally to the City see you and her there? and did he make
any objection to her having been brought here or remaining here?</p>

<p>Answers he did &amp; made no objection.</p>

<p>3rd How far did Mr Ball live from your mothers in Virginia?</p>

<p>Answers a mile or two.</p>

<p>4 Did you or did you not know of Mr H W Ball's ever
residing in Washington till after his marriage?</p>

<pb xml:id="p009" facs="IMG_3636.jpg"/>

<p>Answers He did not reside here till after his marriage though
he was frequently here.</p>

<p>5 Where was your husband during the period of your aforesaid
stay in Fairfax?</p>

<p>Answer This deponent's husband was
an Officer in the Marine Corps stationed in Washington where he
was the greater portion of his time and which he only left on
obtaining leaves of absence keeping no house in Washington
but living when in Washington in the marine barracks, nearly
all his cloathes being in Virginia and he contributing to the expences
of the family in Fairfax &amp; visiting in Fairfax sometimes every
week sometimes not so often and sometimes staying 5 or 6 weeks
together. Until the period of this visit the deponent &amp; Mr
Rankin had lived in Washington. This deponent always 
contemplated returning to Washington but did not suppose it would
take place till late in the year, but Mr Rankin having obtained
an Appointment they were induced to return earlier.</p>

<p>This deposition is agreed to be read in Evidence
as far as admissible in the Case Sally vs Ball</p>
