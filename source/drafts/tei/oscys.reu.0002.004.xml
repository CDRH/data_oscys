<pb xml:id="p003"/>
<p>State of Missouri County Saint Louis ss Deposition of a witness produced
sworn and examined the twenty fourth day
of November eighteen hundred and thirty six, between
the hours of eight in the afternoon and five
in the afternoon of said day, in pursuance of the
notice hereto announced before me D Hough a
<unclear>justice</unclear> of the peace within and for the County aforesaid
, at my office in the City of Saint Louis,
in a certain cause now pending in the Circuit
Court of Saint Louis County between Edward
Gantt plaintiff and Thomas Baldwin defendant
on behalf of the defendant <lb></lb>

John Burt being produced sworn and
examined deposith and saith that he went
on board the Steam Boat Tempest as
<unclear>clerk</unclear> in September 1835 and remained
on board after as clerk till the ensuing
April, and then as capitain 
till August 1836 _ the said Boat
was at St. Louis on the 24th November
1835 _ an attempt was made to go
up to Quincy, but ran up 3 or 4 miles
above Alton and was prevented ascending
higher on account of it. 

<pb xml:id="p004"/>

and then returned to St. Louis _ and
again attempted to go up, and succeeded
in going a little higher than
the first time, but found the river
frozen over and finally returned
again to St. Louis _ and then the said 
Boat started for Louisville somewhere
toward the 10th <unclear>dec</unclear> - 1835 the exact day
not recollected _ The Lady Jackson
Stean Boat started from St. Louis <del>for 
Louisville</del> <add>down the river</add> the day before the Tempest
did, and on the voyage the Tempest
overtook her aground about 100 miles
below St. Louis, and took her passengers
who were bound for Louisville _ 
The Steam Boat Indian left St. Louis
for Louisville on the same day the
Tempest did perhaps about 4 or 5
hours before the Tempest left, and 
about 9 Oclock in the morning _ the Tempest
left about 12 or 1 - The Tempest
overtook the Indian also and took
her passengers - it was a very icy
time _ The trip above mentioned 
was the last trip the Tempest made

<pb xml:id="p005"/>

from St. Louis in 1835 - There was
a deck passenger came on board
at St. Louis with three negroes, two
of them females and one boy _ they
were all black, should think the
eldest female to be about 18 years
old _ the said passenger claims
them as his negroes paid their passage
to the mouth of the Ohio, at which
place he took them oft- There were
no other negroes on board excepting
the Chamber Maid and old <del>negro</del> mulatto
woman who shipped from Pittsburgh
and is now with this deponent on
the J.D Pavillion _ there were also
a negro fireman _ two cooks, free
men, a <unclear>stuard</unclear>, free man, one cabin
boy slave belonging to Baldwin _ the
above mentioned negroes all came
to St. Louis on the Boat _ soon after
perhaps the next morning <add>or sometime during the next day</add> after the Boat
arrived at Louisville, heard that the
Tempest was charged with taking a
mulatto woman from St. Louis

<pb xml:id="p006"/>

<add>heard it</add> from Capt Reed of the Steam Boat <unclear>Gov</unclear>-Clark
which Boat the Tempest met on that trip about twenty
miles below St. Louis _ the report
led to conversation among the 
hands &amp; crew of the Boat, and
enquiry on the part of the Africans 
deponent is confident that no
negro or Mulatto woman except
what property belonged to the Boat
was on said Boat during her
last trip to Louisville, this deponent
made search on this trip
as well as all others to see that
no person was on board who did 
not belong on the Boat, always made
search immediately on leaving port
being so instructed by the Capt and 
having frequently heard of difficult 
ties arising from taking away
Slaves _ deponent <add>on that trip</add> went in to all
parts of the Boat except the hold _
visiting the hold was the duty of the
mate _ The cargo consisted entirely
of Lead about 20 Tons _ It was very

<pb xml:id="p007"/>

cold freezing weather during all
said trip _ No Boat overtook the
Tempest on the trip _ <lb></lb>
Cross Examined <lb/>
The other girl spoken of above above
was small, not more than 14 year old _
Known of no other Boat leaving St. Louis
the same day the Tempest did except
the Indian _ The "Aid" was advertised
to leave the same day but do not
know whether she did _ <unclear>she</unclear> was the
only Boat lying in port bound for
Louisville _ does not know when 
the Aid arrived in Louisville, does
not know whether she or the Gov Clark
arrived first _ The Indian arrived at
Louisville after the Tempest, but does
not recollect how long after, or whether
she or the Gov Clark arrived first _
Lady Jackson did not arrive at all
while the Tempest <unclear>lay</unclear> at Louisville
which was 5 or 6 days - The Tempest
arrived at Louisville in the evening &amp; witness
saw Capt Reed of the Gov Clark the next

<pb xml:id="p008"/>

morning as he thinks _ thinks the Gov
Clark arrived within 24 hours after
the tempest - no person by the name of 
Mr Massie was on board that trip &amp;
witness knows no man by that name.
Known a man by the name of Massie now
Capt of Robert Morris, dont know his
Christian name _ no assistant
clerk that trip, there was one the
trip before, but he remained at Louisville
sick _ witness does not recollect 
the number of freemen on board
that trip, does no recollect whether
any freemen were engaged at St. Louis,
but thinks there were none, nor on
the trip _ the J. B. Robert Morris arrived
at Louisville from St. Louis while
the Tempest lay at Louisville before 
she went to N Orleans and arrived
there after the Gov Clark <lb></lb>
