<p>And the said plaintiff as to the recorded plea of
the said defendant above pleaded says that she the 
said plaintiff ought not for any thing in the 
said second plea alledged to be barred &amp; precluded from having &amp;
maintaining her aforesaid action thereof against him the said defendant
because he says that though it is true that the said defendant
was in due form of care appointed administrator of the estate
of one James Rein in manner and form as the said defendant has 
in his said second plea stated, yet nevertheless for replication to 
the said plea the said plaintiff says that she the said plaintiff
was not on the the first day of January in the year one thousand
eight hundred and twelve in at any other time either before or
after the said first day of January possessed and carefully served
as a slave for life by the said James Rein, and that the said
defendant committed the trespasses in the plaintiff and declaration
complained of without the causes in his second plea stated: and 
this she the said plaintiff prays may be inquired of by the county.</p>

<p>And the said Plaintiff as to the third plea of the said defendant
above pleaded, says that she the said plaintiff ought 
not for any thing in the said third plea alledged to be barred &amp; precluded
from having and maintaining her aforesaid action thereof
against him the said defendant because she says that, 
though true it is that the said defendant was in due form
of law appointed administrator of the estate of one James Rein
in manner and form of the as the said said defendant how in his 
said third plea stated, yet nevertheless for replication to 
the said third plea she said plaintiff says that she the 
said plaintiff was not on the first day of January one thousand 
eight hundred &amp; twelve or at any time either before the said 
first day of January or after the same day the servant
of the said James Rein in manner and form as the said
defendant has in his said third plea stated, and that the 
said defendant committed the trespasses in the plaintiffs
