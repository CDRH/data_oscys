<p>Ann a black woman <lb/>
vs <lb/>
Henry Hight</p>

<p>And the said plaintiff as to the recorded plea of
the said defendant above pleaded says that she the 
said plaintiff ought not for any thing in the 
said second plea alledged to be barred &amp; precluded from having &amp;
maintaining her aforesaid action thereof against him the said defendant
because he says that though it is true that the said defendant
was in due form of care appointed administrator of the estate
of one James Rein in manner and form as the said defendant has 
in his said second plea stated, yet neverthereof for replication to 
the said plea the said plaintiff says that the the said plaintiff
was not on the the first day of January in the year one thousand
eight hundred and twelve in at any other time either before or
after the said first day of January possessed and carefully served
as a slave for life by the said James Rein, and that the said
defendant committed the trespasses in the plaintiff and declaration
complained of without the causes in his second plea stated: and 
this she the said plaintiff prays may be inquired of by the county.</p>
