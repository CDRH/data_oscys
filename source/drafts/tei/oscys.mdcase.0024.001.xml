supposed to be done, say, that they for anything by the said William above in that behalf by pleading before

the afd William of his own proper Wrong, and without such causes, as by the said William above in that
behalf by pleading alledged, made an assault upon the said Jane, and her did beat, wound and Evilly
treat, in manner and form as the afd Arthur &amp;Jane have Complained against the said William and this
they pray may be Inquired of the Country, and the afd William likewise. It is therefore Commanded the
