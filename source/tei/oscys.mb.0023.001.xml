<p>The Jury in this case do find from the evidence that the Petitioner was brought into this County sometime early in January last by one Vale Peyton, which said Peyton was not then, before, or since a resident of this county or District, but brought the said petitioner from Wheeling in Virginia into this County, and that sometime in March last he sold the said Petitioner to the Defendant in the City of Washington, &amp; that it was the intent both of the Seller and Purchaser and so agreed at the time of the sale that the said Petitioner should be sent by the Defendant forthwith to Norfolk in Virginia and that he was forthwith upon such sale put on board the Steam Boat &amp; sent to Norfolk as the Property of the Defendant. And that upon his being put in said Steam Boat, the purchase money was paid by the Deft. That afterwards the said Petitioner returned in the said Steam Boat <del>Norfolk</del> from Norfolk &amp; filed his Petition.</p>

<p>And we do further find that the said Val. Payton was not a person coming into this County to reside therein, but as a Sojourner or Traveller, and that he did not carry the said Petitioner with him when he went away without selling him, or attempt to carry him away without selling him. Also that there is no evidence from which the Jury can find that the said Peyton brought the said Petitioner into this County
