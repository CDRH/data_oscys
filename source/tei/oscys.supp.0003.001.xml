<p>To U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia</p>

<p>Washington, February 18, 1829</p>

<p>I have received this morning a copy of the petition, filed in the Circuit Court by my slaves, and I transmit, herewith, an answer to it, which, for obvious reasons, I wish put upon the file of the Court. I suppose I would ave a right to do that independent of any call upon me in the petition itself: But the petition expressly requires an answer for me.</p>

<pb xml:id="p623"/>

<p>To U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia</p>

<p>Washington, February 18, 1829</p>

<p>The Answer of Henry Clay to the Petition exhibited to the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, for the County of Washington, by Charlotte, alias Lotty, Charles, and Mary Ann, persons of the African race, now in the possession of this respondent, and held by him as slaves.</p>

<p>This respondent does not admit, but expressly denies, that the petitioners, or either of them, have any right, or just claim whatever, to their freedom: That the petitioner, Charlotte, is the mother of the other two petitioners: That about twenty-three years ago, this respondent then residing in the town of Lexington, State of Kentucky, was informed that a negro man belonging to him, named Aaron, had married the petitioner, Charlotte: That she was at that time in the possession of a certain James Condon, who held and claimed her as his slave: That this respondent being desirous that Aaron and Charlotte should live together, proposed to Mr. Condon to purchase her of him, and actuated by that object, finally did purchase her, at the high price of four hundred and fifty dollars. That thereupon Mr. Condon executed a bill of sale for the woman, to this respondent, which he will be ready to produce to this court, whenever required, and a copy of which is now annexed to this answer: That subsequent to this purchase, the other two petitioners were born, and raised in this respondent's family: That this respondent never had the remotest suspicion that Charlotte had any title whatever to her freedom, nor does he yet believe she has any: That the sincerity of this conviction is evinced by the conduct of this respondent in regard to her: That he understands she was born on the eastern shore of Maryland; That about twelve or thirteen years ago, he brought her and her husband, as servants in this respondent's family, to this district, where she remained upwards of a year: That during his abode in the city of Washington, at that time, she paid a visit to her relations on the Eastern Shore of Maryland of several weeks duration; and again, during the Summer before this last, she visited them a period of equal, if not greater, length: That these facts are adverted to, as tending conclusively, to shew that this respondent could not have had the least idea of her having any just pretensions to her freedom.</p>

<p>And this respondent further says, that he has resided between three and four years last past, in the city of Washington, and never heard of any intention to institute this proceeding until about ten or twelve days ago: That he has reason to believe that it has been instigated by motives distinct from the desire of liberating the petitioners, for the purpose of injuring and embarrassing this respondent, who expects to depart from this district, for his residence in Kentucky, in the course of three or four weeks: But from whatever motives it may have been commenced, this respondent acknowledges his subjection to the laws of the District and his obligation to obey them; and he shall readily submit to such order, or orders, as this honorable Court, may, under all the circumstances of the case, deem to be just and proper.</p>
