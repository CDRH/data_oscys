that if they find that Negro Hannah the petitioner lived in the

<pb xml:id="p004" n="IMG_8152.jpg"/>

here unto her the said Negro Hannah granted and soforth. John C. Handy Clk:
State of Maryland, Worcester County, towit; I hereby certify to all whom it doth
or may concern that the aforegoing transcript is a true Copy, taken from the Records
and Proceedings of Worcester County Court. In Testimony whereof I have hereto set
my hand and affixed the Seal of my office this seventh day of September Anno
Domini 1797.</p>

<p>Seal of Worcester County Court</p>

<p>John C. Handy Clk: of Worcester County Court</p>

<p>Thereupon appeared in our said General Court, the afd Negro Hannah by William 
Whittington Esquire her attorney, and said, that in the record and proceedings aforesaid
and also in the giving of Judgment aforesaid, there is manifest Error in this, towit,
that by the Record aforesaid it appears, that the Judgment afd in the plea afd
given, was given for the said James Selby against her the said Negro Hannah, when
by the Law of the Land that Judgment ought to have been given for the said Negro
Hannah against him the said James Selby, therefore, in that there is manifest Error,
and she prayed that the Judgment afd for that Error, and others, being in the Record
and proceedings afd might be reversed, annulled, and held entirely as void, and that 
she the said Negro Hannah might be restored to all that she has lost by occasion
of the Judgment aforesaid; And the said Negro Hannah by her Attorney aforesaid
prayed the Writ of the State of Maryland of Scirefacias, to warn the said
James Selby to be and appear before our said General Court, to hear the Errors assigned
of and upon the Record and proceedings afd, And the said Writ was accordingly
Issued Commanding the Sheriff of Worcester County that by good and lawful men
of his Bailiwick he should make known unto the said James Selby, that he be
and appear before the Judges of our General Court to be held for the Eastern Shore of
the State of Maryland, at Easton in Talbot County, on the second Tuesday of
April then next following, to hear the Record and proceedings, and also the Errors
assigned thereon, if to him it should seem expedient, and further to do and receive
what the Judges of our General Court should then and consider concerning him
in this behalf; and that he the said Sheriff should have then and there the
names of those before whom he should make the same known unto him,
together with that Writ. The same day was given to the said Negro Hannah 
then and there &amp;c. And now here at this day, towit, the second Tuesday of
April in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety eight, comes
the said Negro Hannah by her Attorney afd; and the Sheriff of Worcester County
afd to whom the said Writ of Scirefacias <del>afd</del> was, in form aforesaid directed,
makes thereof to the Court here thus endorsed, towit. "Made known in the presence
of John Doe, and Richard Roe good and lawful men of my Bailiwick, so answers 
Zadock Sturgis, Shff." Whereupon as well the Record and
proceedings afd, and the Judgment given in form afd, as the matters afd by
the said Negro Hannah above for Errors assigned, being seen, and fully considered

<pb xml:id="p005" n="IMG_8153.jpg"/>

by the Court here, and mature deliberation thereon had, it appears, to the Court here that
there is manifest Error, as well in the Record and proceedings aforesaid, as also in the
rendition of the Judgment afd; Therefore it is considered by the Court here, that the
Judgment afd, for those Errors, and others in the Record and proceedings aforesaid, be 
revoked, annulled and held entirely as void; and that the said Negro Hannah be
<del extent="one word"/> Restored to all things which by reason of the Judgment afd she hath lost,
And it is also considered by the Court here that the said Negro Hannah recover
against the said James Selby the quantity of &#160; &#160; &#160; pounds of
Tobacco as well for her Damages which she hath sustained by occasion of the
prosecuting her appeal afd as also for her Costs and Charges by her about her
suit in this behalf laid out and expended: And because it clearly appears to the Court
here, that Justice, and the Merits of this cause require that there should be a new
Trial of the Issue aforesaid; Therefore the Court here according to the directions of the
Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, order and direct a remission of 
the Record and proceedings aforesaid, to the Clerk of the said County Court of Worcester,
with the Writ of the State of Maryland of Procedendo to the said County
Court directing them to proceed in the action aforesaid, and to a new Trial thereof,
in the same manner as if no Trial had taken place or any appeal had been
prosecuted. The Records and Proceedings afd, with the said Writ of Procedendo
are therefore transmitted to the Clerk of Worcester County Court accordingly.</p>
