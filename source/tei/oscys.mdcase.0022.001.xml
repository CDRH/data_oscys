<p>Levin Hughes<lb/> 
against<lb/> 
John Singleton</p>

<p>Be it remembered that on the thirteenth 
day of September Anno Domini seventeen hundred &amp; 
eighty eight, Levin Hughes, by Robert Wright his Attorney 
preferred to the Court here the following Petition for Freedom, 
to wit. "To the Honorable the Judges of the General Court. The Petition of Levin 
Hughes most humbly sheweth that he is unlawfully detained as a Slave by a 
certain John Singleton of Talbot County. Your Petitioner therefore <sic>prayes</sic> that a 
Writ of Subpona may issue against the said John Singleton to appear at this Court 
to shew cause if any he hath why he detains your said Petitioner in Slavery and do 
therein what to your honors may seem just and right and as &amp;c. Levin Hughes 
Robert Wright pro plff. Which said Petition being read and granted it was 
ordered by the court here, that a Subpona should be issued for the said John Singleton
to appear before the Judges of the Court here immediately to answer to the said Petition:
Whereupon command was given to the Sheriff of Talbot County to summon John 
Singleton Esquire that all excuses and delays set aside he be and appear before the  
Judges of the General Court now sitting for the Eastern Shore of this State at Talbot 
County Court-House, <del>the Second Tuesday</del> immediately to answer the Petition of
Freedom of a certain Levin Hughes and he (the sheriff afd) should not fail at his 
peril and so forth. And the Sheriff of Talbot County afd came and made return of 
the said Subpona thus endorsed to wit, "summoned Daniel P Cox Shff."
And the said John Singleton by William Hayward his Attorney came here into 
Court, and thereupon day was given by the Court here to the said Parties, to hear the
allegations and evidence as well on the part and behalf of the said Levin Hughes 
as the said John Singleton, being the Second Tuesday in April then next following.
And now here at this day to wit the said second Tuesday of April Anno Domini
One thousand seven hundred and eighty nine, come again the Parties afd by  
their Attorney afd, and it is agreed that this petitioner is a child of Maria Hughes 
who Petitioned agt Henry Dickinson to obtain her freedom whose Petition has 
been dismissed, and that all the evidence in that Case apply to this case.

<pb xml:id="p002" n="IMG_8158.jpg"/>

And the said evidence being previously heard, it is considered by the Court here,
that the said Petitioner is not entitled to his freedom, and therefore he is remanded again 
to the service of his master John Singleton. James Earle Clk.</p>

<p>Judgment was rendered in this action on the 6th day of May Anno Domini 1789.</p>
