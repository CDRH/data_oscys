Almighty God deposeth and saith that she has lived a near
Neighbour for nearly two years to Mr Sarah Disney the

at several different times informed the deponent since her
acquaintance with her, that the mother of Hannah the
petitioner who is now present was a free woman, free as
the deponent is, and that she could take no rest, and could
not die easy untill she set them at their liberty for that they had
a right to be free, but her children would not let them go.
She further saith that the said Sarah Disney the defendant
informed the deponent that the mother of Hannah had a
son younger than Hannah and who was sucking at his mothers
Breast when her husband William Disney bought them, the
said Hannah and her brother whose name the deponent has
heard was Sharper, and that he is now a freeman in Calvert
County, and she further informed the deponent that they were
bought by her said Husband to serve him untill they come
of age; that they were brought in a vessel from new England
with their mother who was a sickly woman, and sold, (without the
mother) to the defendants Husband; that he bought them when
young as aforesaid and when he brought them home she asked
him why he bought two such young things, to which he answered
that he gave but a mere trifle for them and bought them only
until they came of age and did not buy them for life and
took them for pity's sake or charity's Sake or Words to that
effect. she further told her that the mother died soon after
somewhere in the Neighbourhood. This the said Sarah Disney

<pb n="oscys.mdcase.0015.001.007"/>

William Disney now dead who was the husband of Sarah Disney
the defendant, This deponent has often heard and always understood
that the said Hanah was bought as a slave, as other negroes usually
are, and this deponent never heard untill about the time of the
present Petition or a little before anything to the contrary. This
deponent knows that his nephew William Disney always claimed and
possessed the said Hanah as a slave, and that after the death of
said William his wife Sarah claimed and possessed Hanah and her
Children as slaves, and gave them as slaves to her children. This
deponent has understood that Mrs Sarah Disney changed her religion
and became a Methodist two or three years ago, and since that
time this Deponent has heard of a claim of said Hannah to be free
but this deponent in the course of a very intimate acquaintance
with the family of his Nephew William for forty years, never
heard of any claim of the said Hanah to her freedom before Mrs
Sarah Disney changed her Religion. Sworn to this 19th day of Octo

<p>Joshua Barry in the 20th year of his age being
sworn on the holy Evangely of Almighty God
deposeth and saith, that about two months
ago he was at the plantation where Mrs Disney
the defendant lives, and in conversation with her she told him
that when the petitioner was small and was offered for sale at the
Inspection house point, one Daniel Brooke went down to the
Vessel and asked the old woman (who was the petitioners Mother
if she and her Children were to be sold, and she answered no
she was not to be sold, as Brooke told her, he then returned to
William Disney's (the defendants husband) and William Disney
asked him where his two little negroes were; he answered he
was not going to buy free negroes, and said she (Hannah's
mother) and her children were as free as he was That a few
days afterwards William Disney went down and bought the
Children, the old woman was gone; William Disney brought them
home and in two days afterwards Joseph Howard came over
and asked William Disney why he bought those two negroes
and said they were free, and as the new England Vessels were
going backwards and forwards they would be known and
taken away; William Disney answered, may be no, they will soon
<catchwords>grow</catchwords>

<pb n="oscys.mdcase.0015.001.008"/>

grow out of knowledge and no one will know they had free
parents. The deponent being asked if he knows Eleanor Barnes
sworn in this cause, answers he does. Being asked her
general Character, answers he does not know much about her,
but believes she keeps low company; and says he has seen
Negroes at her house and laughing and talking with her and
he has seen them setting on her bed. And he further says that
as he was <sic>comming</sic> from Mill about a month ago he stopped
at Eleanor Barnes's house and she asked the deponent if Hannah
had come home, he answered no, and asked her if she had been to
Court and was sworn, she answered yes; he then asked her
what she had sworn and she replied that she had sworn that
Mrs Disney had told her that she would have set her negroes free long
ago had it not been for her Children he then went on and when
he got home he related to Mrs Disney what had passed, and
she said she did not say so, and if Eleanor Barnes had sworn
that, she swore false. Being asked if he knew what negroes
he had seen at Eleanor Barnes's answers they were the forge negroes
and on Sundays he had seen Strange Negroes but did not
know to whom they belonged. Being asked if Eleanor Barnes
lives on Land which belongs to the Messrs Snowden's answers she does
This deponent says that he did not understand from Mrs Disney
that she was present or not when the conversation passed
between her Husband and Howard above related, and that
Mrs Disney was in a great passion at the time she mentioned this
conversation. That Mrs Disney, is a Queer old woman she will
say one thing to day, and if affronted another tomorrow.</p>

County aged thirty eight years being
one of the people called Quakers, and 
being called on to declare his knowledge
of this dispute did solemnly declare and affirm that some time in last
month he in conversation with the defendant Sarah Disney heard

sale, Daniel Brookes one of the Neighbours said he would not

<p>Hannah Hawkins
and her Children<lb/>
against<lb/>
Sarah Disney</p>

<p>The Deposition of Stephen Nicholson aged
thirty six years being sworn on the holy 
Evangely of Almighty God in this cause saith
that he has heard that old Daniel Brookes
who lived near south river <sic>Chruch</sic> in Anne
Arundel County many years ago, and before William Disney the
late husband of the defendant bought Hannah the petitioner went
to Hannah's mother Quash Hawkins to buy Hannah and Sharper
<sic>he</sic> brother, and Brooks asked Quash the mother if she would sell
her two Children for life, and she answered no, she would not, the
said Brookes returned and would not buy them and went to the
house of William Disney aforesaid and told Disney of the circumstances
and that he would not buy them as they were not to serve for life
and were to be free at twenty one years of age; that the said William
Disney went down and bought them both, and when he bought
them home his brother asked him his reason for buying the Children
as they were to serve no longer than until they were twenty one years
of age; he replied he did not care as he gave but a <sic>trife</sic> for them. Being 
asked of whom he heard such conversation, answers he does not
remember, but that he has frequently heard the same over and over
again from white people; and he has heard Sarah Disney the
defendant say she wished they could be free, and when it come to
the point she would put in a good word for them; and he further
saith that he has heard in the neighbourhood that Sarah Disney the
defendant has said that Hannah was free, but that she could not set
her free, for if she did the Children would fall upon her for the Estate
that had been wasted, but he cannot recollect the persons of whom he
had this information; and he also says that he has always understood 
that the said Negroes were bought and sold at the inspecting house
Point on South river and that they were brought there by water
This <sic>Deponant</sic> doth not know that Quash Hawkins was the 
mother of Hannah and Sharper, but hath heard so and he
believes the said Quash Hawkins to have been a negro woman
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="oscys.mdcase.0015.001.010"/>

and this deponant knoweth nothing of the Petitioners right to
Freedom, but from flying reports. Sworn to before me this 22d
October 1792. Jno Brice.</p>

<p>Stephen Nicholson being again sworn in the presence of the
Counsel on both sides, saith that about ten years ago he heard
Mrs Disney the defendant and her daughter Rachel say that
Daniel Brookes went to Hannah's Mother, Quash Hawkins to buy
Hannah and Sharpe her brother, and asked Quash if she would
sell them for life to which she answered that she would not. upon 
which Brookes returned and would not buy them, and that
he went to the house of William Disney and told him of the
circumstances; that the said William Disney went down and
bought them both, and when he brought them home his brother
James asked him the reason why he bought them as they were to serve
no longer than until they were twenty one years of age, he replied
he did not care as he gave but a trifle for them. This he has heard from
them often and first about ten years ago which was about two years
after he was acquainted in the Disney family.</p>

defendant Sarah Disney, the day after the said William Disney
had bought and brought home two small negro children,
Hannah the Petitioner and her brother, as he informed the deponent
and West Burgess brother in Law of said William Disney was

he gave but a trifle for them as they were free born, and as soon
as they came of age he should discharge them; upon which his wife
murmured; he told her he had bought them and should keep
them until they were of age, and then should discharge them
as they were free this deponent thinks she was about 12 or 13
years old at the time the above conversation passed between
<catchwords>her</catchwords>

her and Mr Disney. J Bullen.</p>

Hawkins the Petitioner aforesaid and her six Children aforesaid
