To which Evidence so offered by the Defendant the present petitioners Council objected; alleging that a Record of the Conviction of the said Irish Nell for having intermarried with the said Slave should be produced, and that without such conviction neither the said Irish Nell nor any of her Descendants could legally be slaves, whereupon the Court gave the following opinion. That without a conviction in a court of Record of Irish Nell's having intermarried with a slave she could not become a slave, nor could her Issue become slaves by virtue of such Intermarriages. That no presumption of such conviction arises from the petitioner and her ancestors having been always held in slavery that the Court being satisfied that the Records of Saint Mary's County have been lost since the period at which such conviction is supposed to

have taken place; it is not necessary to shew the Record of the said Conviction; but that Hearsay Evidence being the best which can reasonably be expected in this case, may be admitted to prove that such conviction did take place. That no length of possession of the said Irish Nell and her Descendants from the said Marriage as slaves, nor any of the Tracts related in any of the Depositions taken in the said former cause are sufficient to satisfy the Court of such Conviction.
