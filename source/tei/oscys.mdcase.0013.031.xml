She further saith that the Deponents mother was born on the Eastern

The Deposition of Robert John Smith of Anne Arundel County aged forty
four years or thereabouts being first duly sworn on the Holy Evangelists

life heard that such person or her descendants were entitled to their
Freedom until about eight or ten years since &amp; that he at no time
ever had any conversation with either John Tydings or Joseph Mayo
deceased respecting Daniel the slave of Samuel Watkins brother of
Gassaway Watkins, but that about eight or ten years ago the time
above alluded to, he recollects having a conversation with the said
Samuel Watkins the master of said Daniel in which the said Samuel
said there was a talk that the said Daniel intended to try to get
Free, but that he was quite easy about it, for that he was no more
