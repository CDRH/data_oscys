to be brought before us to correct such Error, and the said Richard Booth appearing in Court before us hath said that the record aforesaid before us sent is deminished and the same not yet fully certified to us, for this "that the will of Richard Harrison which was read in Evidence in this cause in the General Court has not been sent up in the record transmitted to the Court of Appeals," and the same Richard Booth hath prayed our writ to be directed to you to certify more fully the truth thereof and it was granted him, therefore we command you, that you search the records remaining in your custody and if it be so then the record of the Proceedings aforesaid between the parties aforesaid in the Petition aforesaid undiminished to us without delay you certify together with this Writ.
