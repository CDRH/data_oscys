<p>Sir<lb/>
The Books which the vestry of King &amp; Queen Parish put in my Hands contains nothing recorded further back than 1744. It is possible the marriage you want might have been recorded in one of them as part of that which contains the marriages is destroyed. If there be any other Book or Books they have never come under my Notice nor have ever I heard of any other. I shall particularly inquire of the several Vestry Men whether they know of any other Book or Books belonging to the said Parish and if there should be any I will make a strict search and if should be successful in finding a Record of the Marriage you write for, I will forward a Certificat with all possible speed. I am yours &amp;c</p>
