The Books which the vestry of King &amp; Queen Parish put in my Hands contains nothing recorded further back than 1744. It is possible the marriage you want might have been recorded in one of them as part of that which contains the marriages is destroyed. If there be any other Book or Books they have never come under my Notice nor have ever I heard of any other. I shall particularly inquire of the several Vestry Men whether they know of any other Book or Books belonging to the said Parish and if there should be any I will make a strict search and if should be successful in finding a Record of the Marriage you write for, I will forward a Certificat with all possible speed. I am yours &amp;c</p>

He further saith that the said Mulatto Moll claimed her Freedom as being the Daughter of a white woman, but this Deponent never heard that she was the daughter of a white woman from any person but herself; nor does he remember ever to have heard any person except herself talk of her claiming her Freedom.

The above Ann Neale was my mother. Item, To the thirteenth Interrogatory this Deponent saith, that I have simply heard that the Negroes calling themselves Shorters pretended to be Descendants of a white woman, but I neither know it to be the case, neither did I ever hear any body assert it to be so.</p>

Being asked, if he even heard of a marriage, between a white woman &amp; a Negro man, in the Neale family, answers he does not know he ever did. The Deponent also saith, that about three years before he was married to one of the daughters of Roswell Neale, he lived with the said Roswell Neale as his overseer. Being asked if he ever knew any white people in the St Mary's County of the name of Shorter, answers, he did not, nor did he ever hear of any people of that name, or of the name of Short, except the petitioning family and that ever since he knew of Jenny Short. Being asked how old Jenny Short was, when he first knew her about sixty years ago answers, That She was an old woman past children bearing, and bent with age at that time. He further saith, that he has lived all his life in the neighbourhood of Roswell Neale and his Family. Being asked if any white woman of the name of Elizabeth Short or Shorter at any time since his remembrance lived in the family of Roswell Neale, answers, that he never knew any such person, and the thinks if any such Person had lived in the Family, he must have known it.

This deponent further saith the knew a white woman of the name of Mary Innes who lived in Roswell Neale's family about fifty years ago who had Mulatto Bastard Children, and the present Descendants of that woman are now free persons and some of them residing in Saint Marys County that her children were small when he first knew them, two of them died and the third was purchased by the Deponent as a servant till she was 31 <sic>year</sic> old, and is now free residing at the head of St Clements Bay and saith that he is certain that if any such woman as Elizabeth Shorter had lived in the family of Roswell Neale he must have heard or known of it.

<pb xml:id="p276" facs="oscys.mdcase.0012.001.036.jpg"/>

woman but her mother lived until said Elizabeth was upwards of thirty years of age. This Deponent well remembers that said Elizabeth was twice married in the life time of her mother and that she lived with her mother five years after the said Elizabeth's second Husband had run away from the settlement. This Deponent saith that for many years before the time of Roswell Neale's death, his Mill at Tomocohen was kept and tended by Ned Short son of Jenny Short, and that old Jenny Short since the time this Deponent first knew her was infirm and old, and this deponent believes she was incapable of tending said Mill. That Roswell Neale has been dead about forty five or forty six years, that Ned Short before mentioned died four or five years before Roswell Neale, and after the death of a Ned Short, the Mill was kept by Alice Handley for two or three years, and after that a negro fellow of Roswell Neale's kept and tended said Mill till she blew up, and this deponent knew the beginning and ending of said Mill and knew or heard of any other persons as Millers to her. The Deponent further saith that he knows a man of the name of Baptist, or John Baptist Anderson who was born in St Mary's County on a place between the Plantation of this Deponent's Father and that of Mr Roswell Neale, That said Anderson must be between fifty and sixty years old at this time, and this Deponent remembers the time when Anderson was born. That this Deponent knew Alice Carroll the mother of Anderson very well; that said Anderson must be between fifty and sixty years old at this time, and this Deponent remembers the time when Anderson was born. That this Deponent knew Alice Carroll the mother of Anderson very well; that said Anderson was a bastard child of hers and took the name of Anderson because his mother was afterwards married to a man of that name, that the said Baptist or John Baptist Anderson was the reputed son Ned Short who kept Mr Neale's Mill and this was generally reported and believed in the neighbourhood and this Deponent has heard that the said Alice never swore this child to any person as she did a second bastard child that was white. This Deponent further saith that said Baptist or John Baptist Anderson shewed by his colour that he was of a mixed breed, being yellow complexioned. This deponent saith that said Anderson lived in Saint Mary's County till he was about twenty five years of age and generally bore a very bad character such as sheep steeling House breaking and Pocket <fw type="catch">picking</fw>

<pb xml:id="p277" facs="oscys.mdcase.0012.001.037.jpg"/>

picking, and clear of him murder, and nothing was too bad for him. That he was a man of no kind of Credit or trust and nobody would believe what he said. That the said Anderson stole a canoe and run off to Virginia about 30 years past, and this Deponent believes he has not since returned to St Mary's County. That this Deponent has heard that said Anderson kept the Mill of Colonel Tuberville in Virginia opposite to St Mary's, and that many of this Deponents Neighbours have told him they have seen said Anderson in Virginia and that he is the same person described in this deposition.
