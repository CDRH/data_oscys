<p>On the trial of this cause the petitioner's Counsel for the purpose of proving that one
    Mary Queen from whom the petitioner is supposed to be descended was of free condition read in
    evidence to the Jury the deposition of sundry witnesses towit, Richard
        Disney, Thomas Warfield, George Davis, Caleb
                    Clarke, Freders Ryland, Richard
                            Harwood, Thomas Harwood and
    Humphry Belt (here insert them from the record) and the petitioner's
    counsel further offered evidence to prove that the petitioner is lineally descended from said
    Mary and the Defendant moved the Court that the declaration of Jiams &amp; Lee as stated in the said
    depositions that Mary Queen was a free woman and that she was brought into
    this Country and sold for seven years was not admissible evidence, but the Court allowed the
    same to be read in evidence as admissible to prove the facts of said Mary Queen being a free woman and of her being brought
    into this country and of her being sold for seven years and the defendant's counsel offered and
    read in evidence to the Jury the following depositions towit. Joseph Lake,
        Richard Beard,
    Benjamin Welsh, Deborah Lusby and Benjamin
        Duvall (here insert them) where upon and after the arguments of Counsel upon the evidence were closed, the
    Defendant's Counsel prayed the Court to instruct the Jury as follows. If the Jury find, from the
    whole evidence that Mary Queen above mentioned, was a yellow or Tawny woman imported from beyond sea, and sold, and from the

                time of such importation and sale till her death actually detained in slavery;-
                    That the dedication of John Jiams, as stated in the Deposition of
                    Thomas Warfield, and the declaration of Lewis Lee as stated in the deposition of George Davis that she was a free woman, are incompetent to prove that she was entitled to freedom and illegally detained in slavery. Which instruction the Court refused to grant but instructed the Jury a follow viz.</p>
                
                <p>If the Jury believed from the evidence that the petitioner is lineally descended
                    in the female line from Mary
                        Queen, and that the said Mary Queen was brought
                    into this Country as a free woman or a servant and sold for seven years, they
                    must find for the petitioner. and the declarations of Capt. Jiams that the
                    said Mary Queen was a free woman and that she was brought into the Country and
                    sold for seven years (as stated in the deposition of Warfield) is admissible
                    evidence to prove those facts. To which <unclear reason="illegible">decisions</unclear> refusal and instructions of the Court the Defendant excepts and prays &amp;c. And this his bill of exception is sealed and enrolled accordingly.</p>
