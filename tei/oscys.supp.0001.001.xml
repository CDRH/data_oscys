<p>A short time after having completed the memorandums above alluded to, the youth just mentioned, having learned the subject on which I had been occupied, and being prompt to communicate whatever he might meet with relative to it, informed me on returning from school, in the evening of the 19th December, 1815, that a black woman, destined for transportation to Georgia, with a coffle which was about to start, attempted to escape, by jumping out of the window of the garret of a three story brick tavern in F. Street, about day break in the morning; and that in the fall she had her back and both arms broken 1 I remarked that I did not wonder that she did so, and inquired whether it had not killed her? To which he replied, that he understood that she was dead, and that the Georgia-men, had gone off with the others. The relation of this shocking disaster, excited considerable agitation in my mind, and fully confirmed the sentiments, which I had already adopted and recorded, of the multiplied horrors added to slavery, when its victims are bought and sold, frequently for distant destinations, with as much indifference as fourfooted beasts. Supposing this to have been a recent occurrence, and being desirous of seeing the mangled slave before she should be buried, I proceeded with some haste, early on the following morning, in search of the house already mentioned. Calling at a house near the one at which the catastrophe occurred, I was informed, that it had been three weeks since it took

place, and that the woman was still living. Having found the house, I desired permission of the landlord to see the wounded woman; to which he assented, and directed a lad to conduct me to her room ; which was in the garret over the third story of the house. On entering the room, I observed her lying upon a bed on the floor, and covered with a white woolen blanket, on which were several spots of blood, (from her wounds,) which I perceived was red, notwithstanding the opacity of her skin. Her countenance, though very pale from the shock she had received, and dejected with grief, appeared complacent and sympathetic. Both her arms were broken between the elbows and wrists, and had undoubtedly been well set and dressed; but from her restlessness, she had displaced the bones again, so that they were perceptibly crooked. have since been informed by the Mayor of the city, who is a physician, and resides not far distant from the place, that he was called to visit her immediately after her fall; and found besides her arms being broken, that the lower part of the spine was badly shattered, so that it was doubtful whether she would ever be capable of walking again, if she should survive. The lady of the Mayor said she was awakened from sleep by the fall of the woman, and heard her heavy struggling groans.</p> 

<p>I inquired of her, whether she was asleep when she sprang from the window. She replied, "No, no more than I am now." Asking her what was the cause of her doing such a frantic act as that, she replied, "They brought me away with two of my children, and would'nt let me see my husband&#8212;they did'nt sell my husband, and I did'nt want to go;&#8212;I was so confus'd and 'istracted, that I did'nt know hardly what I was about&#8212;but I did'nt want to go, and I jumped out of the window;&#8212;but I am sorry now that I did it;&#8212;they have carried my children off with 'em to Carolina." I was informed that the Slave Trader, who had purchased her near Bladensburgh, (she being a legal slave,) gave her to the landlord as a compensation for taking care of her. Thus her family was dispersed from north to south, and herself nearly torn in pieces, without the shadow of a hope of ever seeing or 

<pb xml:id="p044" facs="oscys.supp.0001.001.005.jpg"/>

hearing from her children again! He that can behold this "poor woman," (as a respectable citizen of Washington afterwards expressed himself, on requesting of her landlord the privilege of seeing her,) and listen to her unvarnished story; and then delineate it with the mental pencil, (quill) and then view the picture from his own hand, without a humid eye, I will confess possesses a stouter heart than I do.</p> 

<p>The sympathy of the whole American white population, (and it is presumed of the black also, for they know how to estimate such matters by dear experience,) has recently been very justly excited towards young King Prather, and his "confus'd and 'istracted" mother roaming in search of him, along half the extent of the coast of the United States. As he was kidnapped by a son of Africa, (though not for the detestable purpose of cupidity 
or enslavement, but for a ladder to his own liberty,) it is presumed if Africa's Genius were permitted to offer her sentiments on the subject, she would pronounce it a retort courteous apropos, from Africa to her sister Columbia.</p>

<p>I have since learned many recent instances of the tragical consequences of the usurped trade in the souls and bodies of men,* I have been informed by several dif-</p>

<p>ferent persons in the District of Columbia, that a woman who had been sold in Georgetown, for the southern slave market, cut her own throat, ineffectually, while on the way, in a hack, to the same depository abovementioned; and that on the road to Alexandria, she completed her design of destroying her life, by cutting it again mortally. A statement was published in the Baltimore Telegraph a few months ago, that a female slave who had been sold in Maryland, with her child, on the way from Bladensburgh to Washington, heroically cut the throats of both her child and herself, with mortal effect. This narrative has been since confirmed by a relative of the person who sold them. An African youth, in the city of Philadelphia, lately cut his throat almost mortally, merely from the apprehension, as he said, of being sold. This information was obtained from several respectable citizens of Philadelphia, who had personal knowledge of the fact.</p> 

<p>Believing the facts already recited are sufficient to satisfy every candid reader of the unreasonableness, injustice, and inhumanity of the prevailing interior slave trade, and of the necessity of legislative controul; I will now commence a delineation of the still more outrageous and abominable practice of seizing and selling into exile, men, women, and children, whose freedom and moral rights, are guarenteed by our national and state constitutions.</p>

<p>In the same recess, with that mangled woman, while inter- 
rogating her, I discovered (without having the least previ- 
ous intimation or even suspicion of any thing of the kind), 
three persons of colour, who were born free, and had been 
forcibly seized in the time of night, bound and transported 
in the night, out of their native state, (Delaware) and sold 
as slaves for life, to itinerant Man-Dealers* in Maryland, 
who generally range themselves along near the line of 
division between the two states. One of these was a 
mulatto man, about 21 years of age, I found him thorough- 
ly secured in irons. His arms were manacled with strong 
loops round his wrists, resembling a clevis^ connected by 
a strong iron bolt. On the shelf, over the fire place, lay 
a pair of heavy rough hopples, (or hobbles,) with which 
he said his legs had been fettered until a short time previ- 
ous, but were then secured by a pair of polished gripes, 
(perhaps manufactured for the purpose, resembling the 
patent horse fetters with locks.) connected by a strong 
new tug chain, with a loose end of two or three feet in 
length, lying upon the fioor.f He stated that a journeyman 
to the man with whom he resided, and to whom he had 
been bound to service for a term of years, having decoy- 
ed him into the fields, some distance from the house, late 
in the evening, on pretence of hunting oppossums, two 
strangers rushed upon him with ropes in their hands, and 
with the assistance of the person J just mentioned, bound 



* To those specnlaters in human flesh, who purchase free people 
as well as slaves, without discrimination, I must now apply the title 
of Man-Dealers, instead of Slave Traders. 

I While interrogating him about the manner of his being seized 
and bound, he gave his chains a shake, by moving his feet on the 
floor, and with vexation muttered, " When the devil gets 'em he'll 
chain them.'''' " No, no," said I, you should'nt make such speeches 
as that, perhaps they were brought up to such things and don't know 
any bettor." " Well, but, said he, ihcy know rvhaVs rightS I have 
since been assured that several instances of black man-stealing had 
occurred, in which fathers, sons, brothers, and even wives and 
daughters, were promiscuously engaged.

affair was transacted, that this person, on hearing that the mulalto

his hands, and led hhn with a pistol held each side of 
him, (with which he said they threatened to shoot liim if 
he made any alarm.,) 15 or 20 miles, where he was secret- 
ed ■'till the next evening ; v/hen another person came with 
a chaise and conveyed him to a tavern in Maryland, a lit- 
tle over the line ;* from whence one of the Man-Dealers, 
(who has since been advertised as a man-stealei', in a dif- 
ferent case,) brought him to Washington in m^anacles, and 
sold him to another, as a slave for life. He said his Driver 
overhearing him tell a coloured woman near Annapolis, 
that his parents (both of whom are light coloured mulattos) 
were free-born, threatened to shoot him if he should catch 
him talking to any body again about his being free. He 



man had been intercepted at Washington, said he had a had pain 
on his mind, and believed lie sbould dear out ; which lie had done 
accordingly. 

* Thos. Clarkson stales, in his History of the Abolition of the Slave 
Trade, that the arrival of slave ships, on the coasts of Africa, was 
the uniform signal for the immediate commencement of wars for the 
atlainment of prisoners, for sale and exportation to America and the 
West Indies." In Maryland and Delaware, the same drama is now 
performed in miniature. The arrival of the Man-Traffickers, laden 
with cash, at their respective stations, near the coasts of a great 
American water, called justly, by Mr. Randolph " a Mediterranean 
sea,"" or at their several inlana posts, near the dividing line of Mary- 
land and Delaware, (at some of which they have grated prisons for 
the purpose) is the well known signal for the professed ktdnapperSf 
like beasts of prey, to commence their nightly invasions upon the 
fieecy flocks ; extending their ravages, (generally attended with blood- 
shed, and sometimes murder,) and spreading terror and consterna- 
tion amongst both freemen and slaves throughout the sandy regions, 
from the western to the eastern shores. These " two-legged Jeathcr- 
less animals,''^ or htuman blood-bounds, when overtaken (rarely) by 
the messengers of law, are generally found armed with instruments 
of death, sometimes with pistols with latent spring daggers attached 
to them ! Mr. Cooper, one of the representatives lo congress from 
Delaware, assured me that he had often been afraid to send one of 
his servants out of his house in the evening, from the danger of their 
being seized by kidnappers. 

While at ^Vllmington (Del.) I accidentally heard a black woman 
telling the gate-keeper of the bridge, that she hsud set out to go to 
Georgetown, (Del.) but was returning without having reached it, 
for fear of being caught on the road by the kidnappers.

said tli€ trader did strike him on the head with his fist, 
after his arrival at Washington, for teiUng a person t6 
whom he was offered for sale, that he was lawfully free, 
and threatened to flog him if he should fail of selling him 
in the city on that account. He also stated, that another 
boy, about sixteen, was brought off with him at the same 
time, and sold for a slave in Washington, who. was law- 
full}^ free, and had been sold to the traders, by a person 
to whom the boy's lather had let him to service. 

This statement has been since confirmed by corrobora- 
tive information ; and I am in possession of mem.oran- 
dums, by which the boy might probably be traced and 
found. 

The others v»^hom I found in the same garret, and at 
the same time, were a young black widow woman, with 
an infant at the breast, both of whom were born free. Her 
husband had died but a few days previous to her seizure, 
and she was in a state of pregnancy at the time. She sta- 
ted that the man in whose house she resided, together 
with his brother, and three other persons, (two of whorn 
she said then stood indicted for having seized and carried 
her off at a former time,) came into the room, (a kitchen,) 
where she was in bed, seized and dragged her out ; — fas- 
tened a noose round her neck to prevent her from scream- 
ing, and attempted to blindfold her, which she resisted 
with such violence, that she prevented them from suc- 
ceeding. She said, while one of them was endeavoring 
to fix the bandage over her eyes, that she seized his cheek 
with her teeth, and tore a piece of it entirely off. She 
said oiie of them struck her head several times with a stick 
of wood, from the wounds of which she was almost co- 
vered vv'ith blood. She shewed me a large scar upon her 
forehead, occasioned by one of the blows, which a gen- 
tleman who sav/ her, the day previous to her seizure, has 
since informed me was not there before. She said, while 
she was struggling against them, and screaming, the man 
in whose house she lived, bawled out " choak the d— — d 

b h — don't let her halloo — she'll scare my wife !" 

Having conquered her by superior force, she said, they

placed her with the child in a chaise, (her description of 
which, with the horse and the driver, who was one of the 
victors, corresponds precisely with that given by the mu- 
latto man, of the carriage, &c. by which he also was con> 
veyed,) and refusing to dress herself, three of them, leav- 
ing the two who belonged to the house, carried her off in 
the condition that she was dragged from bed, to a 
certain tavern in Maryland, and sold them both to the 
Man-Dealer, who brought them to the city of Wash- 
ingtcin. She stated, that one of her captors drove the car- 
riage, and held the rope which was fixed to her neck, and 
that one rode each side, on horseback. — That, while one 
of them was negociating a bargain with her purchaser, 
he asked her who her master was; and, replying that 
she had none; her seller beckoned to him to go into 
another room, where the business was adjusted with- 
out troubling her with any farther inquiries. She stated, 
that her purchaser confessed, while on the way to An- 
napolis, that he believed she might have had some claim 
to freedom, and intimated that he would have taken her 
back, if the man,* of whom he bought her had not ran 
away ; but requested her, notwithstanding, to say nothing 
to any body about her being free, which she refused to 
comply with. She affirmed, that he offered her for sale to 
several persons, who refused to purchase^ on account of he?' 
asserting that she was free. She stated, that her pur- 
chaser had left her in Washington, for a few weeks, 
and gone to the Eastern Shore^ in search of more black 
people, in order to make up a drove for Georgia. 

These facts clearly exemplify the safety with which the 
free born, inhabitants of the United States, may be offered 
for sale and sold, even in the Metropolis of Liberty, t as 



* I was informed in Delaware, that her seller absconded in about 
ten days after the outrage was committed. 

f The mulatto youth had been purchased in the city of Wash- 
ington, and kept in it in irons several weeks, by a person who con- 
fessed his regret, that he had not removed him before the suit, for 
the recovery of his freedom, had commenced ; and that, if he had

oxen ; even to those who are notified of the fact|^ and ar& 
perhaps convinced of it, that they are free !* 

The discovery of these captives, on their road to the 
dismal gidph\ of (perh*tips) interminable slavery to them- 
selves, and their muitipjiying progeny ; in this very acci- 
dental, unless providential manner, filled me with a mix- 
ture of astonishment, compassion and joy. With a viev/ 
to commence imimediate legal measures, for restoring 
them to their liberty, I took my pencil and noted down 
their narratives circumstantially. 

I had not quite finished, before the purchaser of the 
mulatto man came into the room. He seemed a little sur- 
prised to find me writing, but made no inquiries about it, 
and having obtained ail the information that I wished, I 
continued noting it down, notwithstanding his being pre- 
sent, until my memorandums were completed ; when I 
left him in the room, without having had any conversation 
with him, except answering some questions, which he 
asked me relative to the wounded slave. Without hesi- 
tation, I commenced a suit in the circuit court of the Uni- 
ted States, for the District of Columbia, for the restitution of 



known it sooner, he would have taken him on to , (-the placjfi 

of his residence,) even if he had been satisfied of his being free. 
One Slave-Trader, to whom he had been offered, was however so 
conscientious, that he refused to purchase him, or the lad who was 
with him (before mentioned) being confident that they were ilfe- 
gally enslaved. 

* I have been ^sured by a gentleman of the highest respectability, 
that a former representative to congress, from one of the southern 
states, acknowledged to him, that he held a mulatto man as a slaVe, 
having purchased him in company wiHi slaves, who affirmed that 
he was free born, and had been kidnapped from one of the New- 
England states, who was well educated, and who, he had no doubt, 
was born as free a man as himself or my informant. Upon being 
asked, how he could bear then to retain him, he replied, that the 
customs of his pajit of the countiy were such, that these things are 
not minded much. 

f I was informed that the mulatto man was probably destined for 
tlie New-Orlean's market, not very far distant from the Gulph of 



PORTRAITURE OF SLAVERY. 51 

their liberty. The first attempt to secure the persons oi 
the captives, by a writ of habeas corpus, was ineffectual. 
I accompanied the deputy marshal myself, to the house in 
which I found them. The landlord declared that, " if 
he had known Ixvas writing so long in the room where the 
Negroes were^ he should have his en very angry with me; 
and that, if I had no other evidence of their freedom, hut 
their stories, we should not see them.'''' He said, he be- 
Heved'-'' Negroes were made to serve the Whites, and that 
they had no more sense than horses. ''^^ He stated, that the 
person who saw me writing, suspected some difficulty, 
and had directed him to conceal the Negroes, and that he 
had done it. He told me, in a sneering mani^er, that if I 
wished to take the^part of the N'egroes, he coiddfind me 
plenty of such business. He informed me, that he had 
been in the way of keeping Negroes for the Traders many 
years, and took better care of them than they received 'in 
the jail.\ 

Notwithstanding the writ of habeas corpus was returned 



Mexico, which probably embraces more personal slavery, including 
its neighboring regions, than any region of equal extent on the globe. 

* Does not this confession demonstrate the great propriety with 
which the word slavery might be substituted in lieu of the word vice, 
in Pope's admirable stanza? thus: 

Slavery is " monster of so frightrnl mien,. 

As to be hated, needs but to be seen ; 

Yet, seen too oft, familiar with her face, 

We first endure — then pity — then embrace." 

f On the ensuing day, having persevered in endeavors to secure 
the captives, the son of this landlord, (to whom I presume inanacles, 
hand-cuffs, iron inan fetters, hopples, SfC. are as familiar as steel- 
traps and snares to the hunter of the animals which yield fur,) ex- 
pressed his sympathy for the loss of the purchaser of the mulatto 
man, (who still remained in his chains,) should \\e be set at liberty. 
I asked him whether he considered it worse for tlie trader to lose a 
few hundred dollars in money, than for the mulatto man to be irans-^ 
ported to a strange country, and b,e deprived of iiis liberty for life. 
To which he replied, after a shoft pause, that he didnot knon: as 
there was much difference! I assured him, that if he did not, I was 
.forr?/ for him. This illustrates the invincible force qf morbid edu- 
cation and of Jjabit. . 



52 PORTRAITURE OF SLAVERY. 

to the magistrate unexecuted, I still persevered, and ob- 
tained a process of injunction, in order to prevent the re^ 
moval of the captives from the District, until the com- 
mencement of the session of the court ; by which it was 
ascertained that they still remained in the same house. A 
second writ of habeas corpus having been issued from the 
court while sitting, they were at length produced, which, 
fortunately, was accomplished on the very day that the 
purchaser of the woman and child left Washington, with 
a coffle of 10 or 12 coloured persons, with whom he had 
just returned from Maryland.* The court having exam- 
ined them, placed tiiem in safe custody for further exam- 
ination at the ensuing summer session, so that time could 
be had for procuring the requisite testimony from Dela- 
w^are. For defraying the expense of accomplishing this 
purpose, and of prosecuting the suits, a subscription was 
drawn up by Francis ^F. Key, esq. who volunteered his 
own services as attorney, gratis, as did also J. B. Cald- 
well, esq. and J. B. Lear, esq. The subscription was 
commenced by general Van Ness ; the heads of the exe- 
cutive departments of the government, with but rare ex- 
ception ; several gentlemen of the senate and house of re- 
presentatives, and the mayor and citizens of Washington 
generally, (possessors of slaves as well as others,) to whom 
application was made, joined in the contribution. I was 
highly gratified to meet with this practical evidence, that 
the disposition to extend the hand of relief to abused Af- 
rican strangers, is not at the present period^ by any means

■^ By information, derived from distinct and corresponding sour- 
ces, a few days after this caravan left Washington, there is no doubt 
of the fact, that it contained, in addition to the slaves, a young black 
woman, who had been emancipated in Delaware, and was sold by 
the same person as an agent, that assisted in seizing and sold the 
bl^ck woman and child ; and also a legally free mulatto man, in 
'irons, who had been sold in the night by his employer, near Phila- 
delphia, and who was most unmercifully beaten with a club, on the 
night previous to their arrival in the city, for telling a person he was 
free.

collected,* I proceeded myself to the state of Delaware ; 
and having travelled from Wilmington to Lewestown and 
Georgetown, returned with unequivocal proof of the legal 
right of the captives to their liberty, which was accord-

One of the attornies having addressed letters to several

rescued from the s some time last winter, and 

seems in the case which occurred then, as well as that 
which you relate, to have been saved by an almost mira-

daring — full of money, &c." 

Understanding that several of the persons concerned in 
the cases had been arrested, and having been informed by 
one of the representatives 'to congress, from Delaware, 
that the laws of that state inflict corporeal punishment for 
offences of this kind, such as whipping, cropping the ears, 
and exposure in the pillory, I wrote a reply to the above 
letter, of which the following is an extract : — 

" Not for vengeance, but for the sake of humanity, I 
hope this fell banditti, with which the free (or ought to be 
free) soil of America is polluted, may be routed. But,
