<p>The Petition of, Letty Brown, for <del>a</del> her self &amp; infant child Robert Brown respectfully sheweth.</p>

<p>That about the year 1817 or 1818, <del>John P. Lowe</del> she being about to be sold by her mistress, Mary Greenfield, and hoping to make an arrangement by wh: she might obtain her freedom, applied to one John H Lowe of the City of Washington (who now claims her &amp; her child as slaves) to assist her in raising money to obtain her freedom; that it was agreed between them that your petitioners should advance forty dollars wh: she then had of her own money &amp; the said Lowe should advance or become <del>resp</del> responsible for the balance of the purchase money (viz 210 dollars) and that the said Lowe should hold her <unclear reason="illegible">nominally</unclear> as a slave mostly to secure to him the repayment of his advance, as fast as she could raise the money. That she has raised &amp; paid to the said Lowe 235 dollars of said money (including the 40 advanced by her) &amp; is ready to pay him the balance due upon his consenting to carry into effect his aforesaid agreement with her.</p>

Your Petitioner therefore prays your Honors to decree her freedom &amp; that of her aforesaid Child &amp; as in duty bound will ever pray &amp; c</p>
