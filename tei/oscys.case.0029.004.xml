<p>Interrogatories to be administered to William Roult of
                    Northumberland County Virginia a
                    witness for the Petitioner in the above mentioned caused to be produced sworn
                    &amp; examined on the part of the said Petitioner against the Defendant above
                    named pursuant to an order of the said Circuit Court, sworn before John Cockarell Esquire a Justice of the peace of the said State of Virginia in &amp; for the county aforesaid</p>
                
<p>First; Do you know Emanuel the Petitioner above named? If so where was he born and raised and to whom did he belong?</p>
                
<p>Secondly; Do you know the hand writing of the pass or permit hereto annexed dated 20th December 1811 at Northumberland County and directed to Henry W. Ball Washington City? Was that pass given by you? Is the signature "Wm Roult" your hand writing? or did you give that or other similar pass?</p>
                
<p>Thirdly; When &amp; by whom was the said Emanuel sold to Henry W. Ball? and where was Emanuel at the time</p>

<p>given him upon his solemn appearances turn by the following new year day.</p>
                
<p>To the Third he saith that the said Emanuel was not sold to the said Ball. In consequence of his failing to return at the time fixed on this affiant, implored his friend Capt. John C Straughan— who was going to Washington City on business of his own to have him arrested and brought back to the State of Virginia— after having been arrested as this affiant has been informed by Capt. Straughan and the said Emanuel escaped from the said Staughan— and while lurking out was exchanged by him with Mr. Henry W. Ball for a fellow of inferior value. This transaction took place in Mar 1812 to the best of this affiants recollection. To the fourth he saith— that the answer is included in that to the third Interrogatory—</p>
                
<p>Question by the defendants agent Capt. Spencer Ball in consequence of Emanuels failure to return to <unclear reason="illegible">Northumberland</unclear> at the time appointed— Did you consider him to be</p>
                
<p>a run away. or did he hire himself out in Washington for your benefit? Answer — I certainly considered him a runaway. and if he hired himself out at all it was not with my permission or for my benefit</p>
