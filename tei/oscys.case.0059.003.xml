<p>If the Jury should believe from the evidence that Mr. Scott
at the time of his leaving the District of Columbia for
Carraccas meant permanantly to reside there with his
family &amp; did reside there
for upwards of 12 months carrying &amp; retaining with him the petitioner until
his return &amp; that his leaving <unclear reason="ripped page">there</unclear>
was owing to compulsion &amp; not his <unclear reason="ripped page">will,</unclear> then the petitioner is entitled to a verdict of freedom</p>  
 
<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0059.003.002.jpg"/>

<p>If the Jury find from the evidence that said Scott proceeded
to Carraccas in a public <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> or a secret mission for the government, and
or a states salary: that he also had some ulterior &amp; contingient views of
remaining longer at Carraccas than was necessary for the
purposes of his mission, and of engaging there in business: but that when he
departed from the District for
Carraccas the duration of his abode there, and the
business he shd engage in <del>was</del> were undetermined &amp; uncertain, and
dependent upon circumstances: and that at the time of his being compelled to
leave Carraccas he had not actually settled himself as a
permanent resident there; but still remained there undecided as to the duration
of his residence, or the footing on which he should establish himself: then the
bringing of the petitioner back from Carraccas to
Maryland &amp; from

Maryland to this District, was not an importation against the Act of Assembly.</p>
