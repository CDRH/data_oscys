</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>Aris Buckner one of the Defendants in the above case makes oath, that he is credibly &amp; certainly informed, &amp; has good reason to think &amp; believe, that a fair and impartial trial of the abovenamed case cannot be had in the County of Washington, where the said suit is depending; and prays for the usual order for removing the same into the County of Alexandria, pursuant to the act of Congress in such cases.</p>

<p>And the said Defendant further makes Oath, that some time early in the session of this Court, commencing in March last, he duly made and presented to the Court then in session an affidavit, duly sworn to in Open Court, of the same effect as above, and thereupon moved the Court for such order as aforesaid: which order, no opposition being thereto made, he understood was granted; and he attended the late Term of this Court at Alexandria, under the full expectation &amp; belief of finding such order carried into effect, and the said case there docketted for trial; but to his surprise discovered that the case had not been transmitted from this Court to that; &amp; upon enquiry finds that, owing to the accidental omission and inadvertency either of the Court or the Clerk, no trace either of the former affidavit, or of the motion and order thereupon made, can be discovered among the papers or records of this court; he presumes 

<pb xml:id="p005" facs="oscys.case.0431.015.005.jpg"/>

<fw type="pageNum">5</fw>

that the affidavit was mislaid by the Court, and the order, though in fact allowed in the mind of the court, was forgotten to be delivered to the Clerk; because the Clerk distinctly recollects the fact of the affidavit being presented to the Court, but has no recollection of any order thereupon being communicated to him from the Court.</p>

<p>This Defendant further states that a suit is depending in the Court at Alexandria, brought by a negro woman, and of the same set of negroes as those who are petitioners in the above cases, against Franklin and Armfield, to whom she was sold, &amp; which suit is defended by this Defendant, as being answerable over; that the last mentioned case is to be tried at the ensuing adjourned Term at Alexandria, when &amp; where it would be highly convenient and save much expence to try all the cases together, as they are all intimately connected together, in the evidence &amp; principles of law in which they depend.<lb/>
