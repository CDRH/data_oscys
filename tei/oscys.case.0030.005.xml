<p>Interrogatories on part of Defendant</p>

<p>1. Was or was not Emanuel the husband of
                    <choice><sic>Violette</sic><corr>Violet</corr></choice> &amp; with whom did he live
                    &amp; how far did he reside from Mount Zion, the
                    residence of Major Gordon.</p> 
                    
<p>When Elizth L. Jones&#8212;first saw
                    or heard of the petitioner Emanuel he was
                    (or said to be) the property of a widow Routt&#8212;of
                    North. Virginia whoes Daughter
                    Catherine Routt&#8212;married William
                        Claughton of said county&#8212;and Emanuel&#8212;the became the property of Mr
                    Claughton&#8212;whoes second marriage&#8212;was with one Captain
                    Blackwell&#8212;and whom died shortly after
                    sd marriage&#8212;(that is within
                    twelve months&#8212;) in the Autumn of 1811&#8212;leaving two Daughters by her first
                    marriage&#8212;and two infants by her last&#8212;Emanuel&#8212;was considered the property of the
                    orphans above mention'd&#8212;But how that business was conducted&#8212;Elizth L.
                        Jones does not know&#8212;and only adds&#8212;that Mr
                    Blackwells&#8212; residence from Mount
                        Sion was about 3 miles&#8212;where Emanuel lived during her life time.</p>
                    
<p>2d. Did Major William
                       Ball ever see or find Violet<del>te</del> before the
                       9th July 1811?</p>
                
<p>Elizth L. Jones&#8212;did not hear of
                    Major Balls making any inquiry about
                    Violet&#8212;altho he was at Mr Gordons
                    before the 9th of July
                        1811 and after
                    Violet was initiated as a domestic in Mr
                    Gordons family&#8212; who was passing about the House without any
                    issue respecting who sh- see her&#8212;</p>
                
<p>3d. Was notice ever given by yourself of Major
                    Gordon or by any other person
                    to your knowledge to the defendant Henry W. Ball
                    or to Major W Ball of
                    <choice><sic>Violette</sic><corr>Violet</corr></choice>
                    being at the house of Major Gordon being between
                    the time of her coming to Virginia &amp; the 9th July 1811.</p>
                
<p>It never occur'd to Elizth L. Jones&#8212;as being necessary for her to give notice to
Henry W.
                        Ball&#8212;that Violet&#8212;was employed as a
                    Domestic in the family of William
                        Gordon&#8212;Nor does she suppose that Mr Gordon, or any other person deem'd it
                    necessary&#8212;as he had made it an object of special business to see Major
                    Ball&#8212;on the subject of
                    Violets being for sale&#8212;Therefore there was nothing to give
                    notice to Major Ball&#8212;about
                    Violet&#8212;as he must have sanction'd her going to Mr.
                    Gordons in the Capacity of a domestic in that gentlemans family.</p>

<p>4. <del>When did <choice><sic>Violett</sic><corr>Violet</corr></choice>s return to the city
                           of Washington with her children?</del></p>
                
<p>Early in October 1811&#8212; Violet
                    together with her two children Winifred &amp;
                    Chloe
                    left North. and return'd to the
                    City of Washington.</p>
                
<p>&#215; Elizth L. Jones&#8212; heard Mr William Gordon observe one morning, at Breakfast&#8212;, to
                    Mrs Gordon that he shd. go that day, to see Major
                    Ball suspecting
                    Violets being
                    for sale&#8212;and if she was that he sd. endeavor to purchase her&#8212; Mr Gordon left
                    Home that day as he had mention and some short time after that&#8212; (perhaps the
                    same week) Violet and her children&#8212;
                    Winifred &amp; Chloe arrived at
                    Mount Sion and Violet was initiated
                    into the service of Mr. Gordons family</p>
                
<p>&#215; Mr H W Ball did not deny
                    (having sent Violet &amp; her children to
                    Northumberland
                    for his Brother Major William Ball to
                        dispose of them by sale&#8212; But to whom or where he was instructed to sell them
                        is impossible for Elizth L. Jones to say as she has before &amp; herein
                        stated.&#8212;) Jones conferred with him on that subject&#8212;) and as to her
                    making any inquiry of him whether his brother&#8212; was acting agreeable to his
                    instructions or not&#8212;Elizth L. Jones having no reason to
                    doubt it&#8212; there fore&#8212; did not ask H W Ball whether he did or did not&#8212;nor did
                    he take occasion&#8212; to say&#8212; that he <gap extent="one abbreviated word" reason="illegible"/> his Brother&#8212; yet the
                    presumption was that he did&#8212; But certain it is&#8212; that he did not deny it,
                    <del><gap extent="one and one half lines of text" reason="illegible"/></del></p>
                
<p>On this 3rd day of June AD 1814 Personally
                    appeared before me the subscriber, Elizabeth L. Jones &amp;
                    made oath to the truth of the answers to the Interrogatories proposed on the
                    part of the Petitioners Defts.</p>
                
<p>Sworn before me&#8212;<lb/>
