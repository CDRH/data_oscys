<p>Interrogatories on part of Defendant</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">
  
<p>1. Was or was not Emanuel the husband of
Violette &amp; with whom did he live
&amp; how far did he reside from Mount Zion, the
residence of Major Gordon.</p> 

<p>When Elizth L. Jones—first saw
or heard of the petitioner Emanuel he was
(or said to be) the property of a widow Routt—of
North. Virginia whoes Daughter
Catherine Routt—married William
Claughton of said county—and Emanuel—the became the property of Mrs
Claughton—whoes second marriage—was with one Captain
Blackwell—and whom died shortly after
sd marriage—(that is within
twelve months—) in the Autumn of 1811—leaving two Daughters by her first
marriage—and two infants by her last—Emanuel—was considered the property of the
orphans above mention'd—But how that business was conducted—Elizth L.
Jones does not know—and only adds—that Mr
Blackwells— residence from Mount
Sion was about 3 miles—where Emanuel lived during her life time.</p>

<p>2d. Did Major William
   Ball ever see or find Violet<del>te</del> before the
   9th July 1811?</p>

<p>Elizth L. Jones—did not hear of
Major Balls making any inquiry about
Violet—altho he was at Mr Gordons
before the 9th of July
1811 and after
Violet was initiated as a domestic in Mr
Gordons family— who was passing about the House without any
issue respecting who sh- see her—</p>

<p>3d. Was notice ever given by yourself of Major
Gordon or by any other person
to your knowledge to the defendant Henry W. Ball
or to Major W Ball of
Violette
being at the house of Major Gordon being between
the time of her coming to Virginia &amp; the 9th July 1811.</p>

<p>It never occur'd to Elizth L. Jones—as being necessary for her to give notice to
Henry W.
Ball—that Violet—was employed as a
Domestic in the family of William
Gordon—Nor does she suppose that Mr Gordon, or any other person deem'd it
necessary—as he had made it an object of special business to see Major
Ball—on the subject of
Violets being for sale—Therefore there was nothing to give
notice to Major Ball—about
Violet—as he must have sanction'd her going to Mr.
Gordons in the Capacity of a domestic in that gentlemans family.</p>

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0030.005.002.jpg"/>
   
<p>4. <del>When did Violetts return to the city
   of Washington with her children?</del></p>

<p>Early in October 1811— Violet
together with her two children Winifred &amp;
Chloe
left North. and return'd to the
City of Washington.</p>

<p>× Elizth L. Jones— heard Mr William Gordon observe one morning, at Breakfast—, to
Mrs Gordon that he shd. go that day, to see Major
Ball suspecting
Violets being
for sale—and if she was that he sd. endeavor to purchase her— Mr Gordon left
Home that day as he had mention and some short time after that— (perhaps the
same week) Violet and her children—
Winifred &amp; Chloe arrived at
Mount Sion and Violet was initiated
into the service of Mr. Gordons family</p>

<p>× Mr H W Ball did not deny
(having sent Violet &amp; her children to
Northumberland
for his Brother Major William Ball to
dispose of them by sale— But to whom or where he was instructed to sell them
is impossible for Elizth L. Jones to say as she has before &amp; herein
stated.—) Jones conferred with him on that subject—) and as to her
making any inquiry of him whether his brother— was acting agreeable to his
instructions or not—Elizth L. Jones having no reason to
doubt it— there fore— did not ask H W Ball whether he did or did not—nor did
he take occasion— to say— that he <gap extent="one abbreviated word" reason="illegible"/> his Brother— yet the
presumption was that he did— But certain it is— that he did not deny it,
<del><gap extent="one and one half lines of text" reason="illegible"/></del></p>

<p>On this 3rd day of June AD 1814 Personally
appeared before me the subscriber, Elizabeth L. Jones &amp;
made oath to the truth of the answers to the Interrogatories proposed on the
part of the Petitioners Defts.</p>

<p>Sworn before me—<lb/>
