<p>For the Plaintiffs</p>

<p>I answer the 1st Int. I know the defendants. I first knew them in 1819. My intimacy with them began sometime in 1828. I answer the 2nd Int. I know Henry, Frank, &#38; Sarah. Henry &#38; Sarah I cannot tell exactly how long but certainly in 1828. Frank I first saw in Dr Laurie's family between Novemr 1828 &#38; April 1829. The child Lucy I never saw. I have never known any other negroes of the same name in the family of either of the defendants or any such belonging to, or claimed by the defendants or either of them as slaves. or any such of the same name, in whom the said defendants or either of them claimed any right or interest.</p>

<p>For the defendants</p>

<p>I answer the 1st Int. I have heard that Mrs Laurie had only a life interest in these negroes, but how I heard it I cannot now recollect. Dr Hall I think has told me that they belong to him at his mothers death. Dr. Laurie's interest in them I have always heard was derived from his wife.</p>

<p>I answer the 2d Int. I have always heard that the negroes Henry, Frank &#38; Sarah were slaves for life.</p>
