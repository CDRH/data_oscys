<p>To the Honorable the Judges of the United States Circuit Court for the County of Alexandria.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The petition <del>of Rachel</del> of negro Rachel otherwise called Rachel Graham humbly and respectfully shews to your Honors that she is now confined and has been confined in the Jail of Alexa. County for several months. That being entitled to her freedom and being claimed as a slaves by Mrs Frances Swann She made complaint thereof as the law directs to Charles McKnight Esqr. as magistrate for said County who issued his warrant summoning the said Frances to appear &amp; answer your petitioners complaint. That the said Frances wholly failed to give the bond &amp; security conditioned to suffer your petitioner to appear at the next court thereafter for the purpose of petitioning your Honors to be allowed to sue in forma pauperis for the recovery of her freedom; whereupon your petitioner was by the said magistrate ordered into the custody of Theodore Meade the officer who served the said warrant to be safely kept according to law until the sitting of the present term of your Honorable Court. That the said Meade committed your petitioner for safe keeping to the Jail of Alexa. County.</p>

<p>That the material facts on which your petitioner <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> for her freedom are that she was born in the City of Washington of a woman named Milly then the property of Miss &#160; &#160; &#160; Brown. That Milly had resided in Washington for many years before the birth of your petitioner &amp; continued to reside there as did your petitioner for a long time after her birth. That at this time Miss &#160; &#160; &#160; Brown was a resident of Alexa. County and continued to reside in Alexa County ever afterwards. That some time after the birth of your petitioner she was removed by Miss Brown to Alexa. County and there sold to Mrs Frances Alexander. That your petitioner has been detained in slavery in Alexa County ever since.</p>

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0435.001.002.jpg"/>

<p>That under the laws of Va. <del>against</del> prohibiting the importation of slaves, your petitioner by the said removal &amp; detention became entitled to her freedom; the ninth section of the Act of Congress, approved 24th June 1812 entitled "An act to amend the laws within the District of Columbia", not giving any power or authority to the said Brown to make such removal or importation, as in similar cases has been heretofore decided by your Honorable Court.</p>

<p>Your petitioner therefore prays of your Honors to assign her council, according to law to prosecute her suit for her in forma pauperis against said Frances Swann to recover her freedom. And prays of your Honors to direct the clerk of your court to issue process for your petitioner against the said Frances Swann to appear and answer the present Complaint. <del>Your petitioner appends the opinion</del></p>
