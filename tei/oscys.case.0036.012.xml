<p>Answers. To the first question</p>

<p>If the Widow stands to the will I apprehend she cannot interfere with the
Provision made in favor of the negroes or prevent its taking effect.</p>

<p>To the Second</p>

<p>I think as to the negroes who will be entitled to
freedom under the will there ought to be a double appraisment one Column stating
the value of them as servants for the time they are to remain slaves— the
other column stating their value as they ought to be appraised provided there
had been no provisions in the will for their future freedom for as <unclear reason="illegible">to</unclear> <unclear reason="illegible">creditors</unclear> the
Executor would be answerable to their full value as a Testator cannot manumit slaves to
their <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> </p>

<p>All such slaves as are upwards of forty five years of age or shall become upwards
of forty five years of age before their time of labour would expire are to be
appraised as slaves— the will not operating in their favor.</p>

<p>To the third</p>

<p>Such negroes cannot be free.</p>

<p>To the 4th</p>

<p>Such increase will not be entitled to their freedom</p>

<p>To the 5th</p>

<p>The <unclear reason="illegible">devise</unclear> to Mrs
Abeal is a lapsed legacy in consequence of her Death in the
life time of the Testator and goes as a part &amp; the residuum to the
residuary Legalee.</p>

<p>The sixth Question</p>

<p>is answered by the answer to the first—</p>


<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0036.012.002.jpg"/>
   
   
   <p>To the 7th</p>

<p>If she quits her claim under the will and resorts to her legal eighth— as
far as she takes negroes in part of her third she can only take them to serve
her for the pound, directed by the will— and can be only changed with the
value to which <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> period of <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> are apparaised.</p>

<p>To the Eighth</p>

<p>As Mr Thompson made a will, she the widow should renounce
yet I am opinion she can only be entitled to the third of the personal
Estate— the question is however depending before the General Court.</p>

<p>To the Ninth</p>

<p>James Thompson <unclear reason="illegible">takes</unclear> in the real Estate <unclear reason="illegible">deceased</unclear> whom an Estate for
Life with <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/>
Estate to this first <del>Charles</del> son he may have by his present
wife— Should he have no such son, <del>but Daughter</del> he has the
<unclear reason="illegible">period</unclear>
of appointing such of his children as he thinks proper to take the same
agrreeable to the will</p>

<p>As to the personal Estate Mr Thompson takes the <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> of the personal
Estate for his life if he should have a son by his present wife that son would
probably be entitled to it after her death— or it will go in the usual
<gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> of distribution</p>
