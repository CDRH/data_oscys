<p>To the Honorable Judges of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia sitting at Alexandria.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The Subscriber who was assigned as Counsel for negroe William to state and report his claim to freedom and the evidence in support thereof respectfully reports.</p>

<p>That from the evidence of Gerard Plummer &amp; Bryan Hampson, whose affidavits are herewith submitted it appears that  the Petitioner had been brought up in Prince Georges County in the State of Maryland as the property of John Plummer, and that on the said Johns death he became the property of his widow by whom he was imported <del>as</del> sent into the County of Alexandria, where he has remained more than one year.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the Importer of the Petitioner has brought himself within any of the exceptions to the Act prohibiting the Importation of Slaves.</p>

<p>The Subscriber is therefore of Opinion that his Importation was in violation of the said Act, and that he is entitled to his freedom &amp; should be permitted to institute Suit in forma pauperis for the recovery thereof against John Swann by whom he is now illegally held.</p>

<p>R. I. Taylor</p>
