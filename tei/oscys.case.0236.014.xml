<p>Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ late of the county aforesaid Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ attached to answer unto Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ in a plea of trespass on the case, and so forth. Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ And whereupon the said plaintiff by Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ attorney complain that, whereas, heretofore, to wit: on the Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ day of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ at Washington to wit at the County aforesaid one <del>one</del> made Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ certain Note in writing, Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ commonly called a Promissory Note, Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ own proper hand-writing being thereunto subscribed, bearing date the day and year aforesaid and thereby then and there promised to pay to Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ by the name of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ or order, the full just sum of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ dollars Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ cents, current money of the United States, for value received Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ and then and there delivered the said Note to the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ And the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ to whom or to whose order the payment of the said sum of money in the said Note mentioned, was to be made afterwards and before the payment thereof, and before the time limited in the said Note for the payment thereof, to wit: on the day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, endorsed the said Note Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ own proper hand-writing, being thereon subscribed, and thereby ordered and appointed the contents of the said Note to be paid to the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ and then and there delivered the said Note so endorsed, to the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ of which said endorsement so made as aforesaid on the said Note the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ afterwards to wit: on the day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, had notice. Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ</p>

<p>And the plaintiff averᾹ Ᾱ Ᾱ that afterwards, and after the expiration of the said time limited in the said Note, for the payment thereof, to wit: on the Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ day of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ in the year eighteen hundred and Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ aforesaid, Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ showed and presented the said Note, with the endorsements so made thereon as aforesaid, to the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ and then and there required the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ to pay the same; but the said Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ did not then, or at any time since, pay the same or any part thereof, to the said plaintiff but then and there wholly refused to do; of all which premises the said defendant afterwards, to wit: on the day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, had notice</p>

<p>By reason whereof, and by force of the statue, in such case made and provided, the defendant became liable to pay the said sum of money, in the said Note mentioned, to the plaintiff (according to the tenor and effect of the same, and the said endorsement thereon) and being so liable, in consideration thereof, then and there undertook, and promised to pay the same to the plaintiff according to the tenor and effect thereof, and the endorsement thereon, whenever afterwards Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ should be thereto requested.</p>

<p>And, whereas, the defendant afterwards, that is to say on the Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ day of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ in the year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid accounted with the plaintiff of and concerning divers sums of money from the said defendant to the said plaintiff before that time due owing then in arrear and unpaid and upon such accounting the said defendant Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ then and there found in arrear and indebted to the said plaintiff in the further sum of Ᾱ Ᾱ Ᾱ and being so found in arrear and indebted, the said defendant afterward, that is to say: on the day and year last mentioned, at the county aforesaid, in consideration thereof, undertook and then and there faithfully promised to pay to the plaintiff when thereto afterwards required, the said last mentioned sum of money.</p>
