<p>In the name of God.</p>
     
<p>I Thomas Boothe, of the City of Washington and District of Columbia, being in a feeble state of bodily health; but of sound mind and memory, and being sensible of the uncertainty of human life, have deemed it proper to make and declare, this, as my last will and Testament. Item. First, It is my will and desire, that after my death, all my just debts, including the necessary funeral expenses, shall be paid, out of any money or personal property I may leave.</p>

<p>Item. Second It is further my will and desire, that my beloved wife, Ann Boothe, in the event of her surviving me, should possess and enjoy, all my property, real and personal, during her single life. And for her greater convenience, and ampleness of right and possession, and enjoyment of the same, I do further constitute her, the said Ann Boothe, my sole Executrix.</p>

<p>And I do hereby revoke and declare void, any other, or former wills, which I may have made, which is contrary to the foregoing. as given under my hand and seal, this Sixteenth day of April, In the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and forty three.</p>
