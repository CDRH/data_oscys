That the said Middleton then removed into the State of Virginia, to reside, and left the said slave in Maryland, with her former master. That on the 7th of December, 1820, the said petitioner was carried by the said Henry O. Middleton, to Fredericksburg, in Virginia, where he then resided, and hath resided ever since, with an agreement and understanding between the said Middleton and the said petitioner, that if she did not like to continue in Fredericksburg she should return and get a master, either in Maryland or the district, as she might choose. That after staying some time in Fredericksburg, the said petitioner became dissatisfied, and expressed her desire to return; in consequence of which, the said Middleton, on the 7th of December, 1821, gave her a pass authorizing her to proceed from Fredericksburg to Washington, where the petitioner then was, and sold her to the defendant.</p>
