<p>To</p>

<p>The Honourable the Judges of the Circuit Court for the 
County of Washington, District of Columbia</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">
  
<p>The petition of Richard Luckett, a negro man of the 
County of Washington, District of Columbia 
aforesaid, humbly sheweth unto your Honours, that sometimes about the year
1782 or 3 your petitioner was held and owned by a certain Thomas Macubbin 
of Montgomery County, State of Maryland. That 
while so held and owned by the said Thomas Macubbin he the said Thomas 
removed to the State of Virginia and removed and imported into the 
said State of Virginia your petitioner to reside. That upon such 
importation the Acts of Assembly of the State of Virginia required 
a certain Affidavit to be made by the said Thomas and in the absence of 
such Affidavit gave freedom to your petitioner That the said Thomas neglected 
&amp; omitted to make such Affidavit whereby your petitioner acquired title to freedom.</p>

<p>That after the said Thomas had resided and held said petitioner 
in the State of Virginia eight or nine years, he removed to the 
State of Maryland and removed and imported your petitioner into the State of 
Maryland, to reside and neglected &amp; omitted to comply

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0045.001.002.jpg"/>

to comply with certain requisites contained in certain Acts of Assembly 
of the State of Maryland prohibiting the importation 
of Slaves into the State of Maryland then in force. That 
if your petitioner had not acquired a title to freedom under the laws of 
the State of Virginia by his removal to the said State, 
then he would have acquired title to freedom by his importation to reside 
in the State of Maryland</p>

<p>That your petitioner came to the possession of a certain Janet Lingan 
who now sets up claim to him under some pretended or aledged purchase or bequest 
or descent and that your petitioner is now unjustly and illegally held in bondage 
by the said Janet Lingan.</p>

<p>Your petitioner prays your Honours to take his case into consideration and to grant 
him a fair &amp; impartial trial according to the Law of the Land and your 
petitioner will ever pray and so forth</p>

<p>Augst Taney for petitioner</p>

<p>July 3d 1821</p>
