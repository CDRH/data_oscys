John Jiams, now deceased, was Inspector, and the said Inspector was going to mark the tobacco with the name of the deponent when the deponent told him not, but to mark it with the name of John Carrick priest, upon which the said Capt. John Jiams asked him what he had to do with priest Carrick, to which the deponent answered he was Overseer for him; the said John Jiams them asked the deponent if he knew old Phillis who lived at the quarter, to which he answered that he did know her very well; the deponent then asked the said John Jiams if he knew her, and he answered he knew her very well, and said she was as free as he was if she had her right; the deponent then asked him how she came to be free, and he answered that <gap extent="unknown" reason="strikethrough"/> her mother was free and was brought into this Country by Captain Larkin and was sold for seven years, and <del>was bought by Mr Chapman</del> the deponent thinks the said Jiams told him that she was sold to one of the Chapmans; and he further says that the said Captain Jiams told him that her name was Mary Queen, to the best of his recollection; and that she afterwards belonged to James Carrick who lived at Fingal in Ann Arundel County, and who as this deponent has understood left the place aforementioned
