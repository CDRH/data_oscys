<p>The Petition of Lotty, respectfully sheweth <del>that</del> to the Honorable the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Alexandria respectfully sheweth that, on the 10th of March 1814, Thomas Ewell of the County of Washington did liberate her &amp; her husband Charles who has since departed this life, as will appear from <gap extent="two words" reason="strikethrough"/> a paper signed by the said Thomas Ewell, which she prays may be received as a part of this petition.</p>

<p>That she remained with the said Thomas Ewell the twelve months mentioned in the said paper. And from the end of the said twelve months, <del>the</del> your petitioner has lived as a free person &amp; supported her self untill about <del>about</del> two weeks ago when the said Thomas Ewell sold her to a man by the name of <unclear reason="illegible">Allow</unclear>, who took her away in the night &amp; brought her to the town of Alexandria &amp; sold her to William F. Luckie who now detains her as a slave &amp; will remove her without the Jurisdiction of this Court. Your petitioner <gap extent="one word" reason="strikethrough"/> states, that she is illegally detained as a slave by the said Ewell She therefore prays leave to be <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> permitted to bring Her suit in <gap extent="one word" reason="strikethrough"/> forma pauperis against the said

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0390.001.002.jpg"/>

William F Luckee <gap extent="two or three words" reason="strikethrough"/> for her freedom. Your petitioner further states that after she was liberated by the said Thomas Ewell named Henney and Anne, in whose behalf she also prays leave to bring suit in forma pauperis for their freedom &amp;c</p>

<p>I have examined into the claim of the petitioner for her freedom and from the written acknowledgment of William F. Lucket it appears those who brought &amp; <del>who</del> detains her as a slave it appears she is intitled to her freedom and that her children are entitled to their freedom. <del>when</del> The written acknowledgement of Mr. Lucket is hereto annexed.</p>
