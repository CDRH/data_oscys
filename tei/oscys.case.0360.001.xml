<p>If the Jury believe from the whole evidence aforesaid that R. B. Gardiner, the owner of Matilda, wrote the letter of 20 Feby. 1827 to Edd Sims. &#38; that shortly after rec:g said letter &#38; in the same year the said Sims allowed the said Matilda to marry the Deft &#38; to go at large as a free person with him. &#38; that she did thereupon go at large &#38; live with her said husband as his wife and as a free woman from that time to the year 1840. And that during that period she bore the children named in the declaration, which children were nurtured &#38; raised by her &#38; her husband, &#38; at their expense. And that the fact of her so going at large as free, &#38; bearing &#38; maintaining her said children was known to said Sims &#38; the said Gardiner. And was also made known to the said Pltfs in the year 1833, after the death of said Gardiner, who upon that information being given <del>did not</del> omitted to include said negroes in the Inventory of said R B Gardiner's estate &#38; never claimed the said negroes till the bringing this suit. Then it is competent <del>that</del> for the Jury to presume a <del>deed of</del> manumission in favor of said Matilda. And further then such going at large for said period as free under the circumstances above stated if believed by the Jury, with such knowledge of said Sims, Gardiner &#38; Pltfs, constitutes a right to freedom.</p>
