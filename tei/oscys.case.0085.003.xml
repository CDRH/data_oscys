That your petitioner is advised that the said sale is contrary to law, and that your petitioner is entitled to his freedom. That the said Rowley has caused your Petitioner to be removed from the said County of Washington to the common jail of Alexandria County, where your petitioner is now confined, preparatory to his removal from this District. And your petitioner states further, that he has filed his petition on the Common law side of this Honorable Court against the said Rowley for his freedom. That the said Rowley is now about to remove your petitioner from this District, and unless he shall be enjoined and restrained by this Honorable Court from so doing your petitioner will be deprived of all benefit of said petition.
