they wanted this kind of Servants to serve longer than they ought to serve; that she said just so they served Ann Joyce's family, that by all accounts they are in confinement now, and they ought to have been free long ago. That the said Mary Hurdle was an old Woman at that time and has been dead about thirty Years; that the Deponent has always understood that the said Mary Hurdle was one hundred and two years of age when she died; That some of the Company asked her who Anne Joyce was and she said she came into this Country a Young Woman with Lord Baltimore, That the said Mary Hurdle then lived near Nottingham and this deponent and her husband lived with her, That she always lived in Prince Georges County as the deponent understood from her; that she came into this Country when about thirteen years old and served her time for her passage four years in the neighbourhood of Upper Marlborough as she had heard her say; and she has understood from Mary Hurdle that she came into this Country about the time that Lord Baltimore came in; That she recollects that she heard Mary Hurdle say that if Lord Baltimore had staid here, it would not have been so; That she has also heard the Tuckers and Lovejoys who were old people and who are now dead talk about it, but can't recollect what they said, now than they censured those who kept them; That she heard her Mother in Law speak of Mr Darnall and Mr Carroll as great folks but she does not remember that she ever heard her mother in Law say that Joice lived with Mr Darnall or Mr Carroll or with whom she lived. Did you ever mention the circumstances that you have above related to any person and to whom and when.

That her Daughter may have casually heard her speak of the subject but she never did directly and purposely converse with her said Daughter about it.</p>
