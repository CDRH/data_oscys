<p>William a colored man vs. Lemuel Sawyer</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>Be it remembered that in this cause, on the trial thereof the plaintiff introduced a witness who proved that when he served the process in this case on the defendant, the said defendant stated that he had bought the plaintiff in the district from a man named Valentine Peyton, who had come on a visit to the district from Wheeling in Virginia that he had taken a bill of sale for the said plt that the price was $325: that in a day or two, or two or three days, the defendant who was a member of Congress from North Carolina, had sent him by the steam boat to Norfolk in Virginia where he was to remain, until he the deft should arrive.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The plaintiff also exhibited <del>a letter</del> as evidence a letter which the defendant admitted to have been written by him which letter, addressed to "Captain Jenkins, Potomac," and subscribed L Sawyer is in the words following to wit (<gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> the letter verbatim</p>

<p>which <del>evidence</del> being all the evidence offered in on the part of the plaintiff the deft by his counsel doth demur <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> as insufficient in law to support the said plaintiffs case as set forth in the <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> Petitioner: wherefore he prays that the Jury may be discharged from rendering their verdict, in this Case, until the matter of law can be heard: <del>wherefore the plf avers that the evidence aforesaid is sufficient &amp; prays the Judgment of the Court thereon</del></p>

<p>* The plf further proved that Valentine Peyton, soon after  the sale left the City, and in debt, and has <del>never</del> not returned: that the plf was sold by <unclear reason="illegible">Poor</unclear> as an auctioneer, and was <gap extent="two words" reason="illegible"/> on board the steam boat &amp; sent away immediately: that he was <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> on board the steam boat that same day

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="oscys.case.0050.006.002.jpg"/>

and the price was afterwards paid: that <del>Plf</del> Peyton told the plaintiff when he was <del>going to</del> at the steam boat <del>or at</del> wharf it, that he would meet him down the river.— perhaps at Chapters.</p>

<p>But the Court refused to discharge the Jury <del>and required</del> and refused to require the plt to join in the demurrer, unless the defendant would admit such facts as might be fairly referred by the Court from the evidence aforesaid: which facts were (1) that the Petitioner was brought into the district with intent to sell him (2) that there is no other claimant of the petitioner in existence: 3. That he was secretly sold without the power of claiming his freedom and removed from the district immediately after the sale <unclear reason="illegible">with a</unclear> view to prevent his claiming his freedom: which facts the defendant refused to admit: whereupon the Court decreed the trial to proceed before the Jury: to which opinion &amp; direction of the Court the deft by his Counsel <del>objects</del> Excepts, and prays the Court to sign &amp; seal this his bill of exceptions in order that the same may be made part of the record in this cause.</p>

<p>Capn Jenkins ought not <gap extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> brought back my negroe. He was not free, but a lying rascal. He passd here a whole winter, as the slave of V.
