<p>Violet &amp; children<lb/>

W. H. Ball</p>

<p>Interrogatories to be answered by Miss Jones on the part of the Petitioners.</p>
 
<p>1st. Do you know the Petitioners &amp; where did they reside before they were brought to the City of Washington? &amp; about what time were they removed?</p>

<p>The petitioner Violet is a native of the State of Virginia &amp; County of
Northumberland—where she remained all her life—until the
spring of 1807—at which time—by the authority of Henry Waring Ball (whoes property she
became by his marriage with Sally Shelton Jones—) She was
removed with other property of his to Fairfax County
Virginia—And when Violet
was originally brought or sent to the city of
Washington—Elizath L. Jones knows nothing abt.</p>

<p>2nd. Did the said Petitioners after their removal
to Washington &amp; when, return to the State of Virginia?</p>

<p>Some time in the month of March or (April)
1811—Violet—together with her two
children—Winifred &amp; Chloe—(all the property of Henry W. Ball—) arrived in
Northumberland County State of
Virginia—From the City of Washington—</p>

<p>3. Did you understand from Violet on her said return from for what purpose she
returned &amp; did you ever afterwards in a conversation with the Deft
communicate what Violet had said upon that subject &amp; did he
deny having sent her to Virginia to be sold?—</p>

<p>Violet said that her-self and children were to be
disposed of by sale and that she had requested her Master Henry W. Ball—to allow her to be sold in
the neighbourhood where her husband Emanuel lived—and that
Major Ball—was to attend to the
business.—</p>

<p>4. Where did the said Violet stay while in Virginia after her return there? Did
she stay at Mr Gordon's — By whose consent &amp; direction &amp; for what purpose did
she stay there &amp; how long &amp; when she did leave there.—</p>

<p>From early in April 1811—until about the 9th of July 1811—Violet stayed at Mount
Sion Northumberland Virginia—and was
employed as a domestic in William
Gordon's family—who several times mentioned in the presence
and hearing of Elizth L. Jones—some doubts whether he could obtain—a good title to Violet and her children—Winifred—and Chloe—as he was a resident in the
State of Virginia—</p>

<p>5. Did you see Major Ball at Mr Gordon's or
elsewhere after Violet's return to
Virginia—Did or or did he not say he
was ordered or authorized by his Brother the Deft to sell her &amp; her
children—Did he or did he not offer to sell her &amp; children to Mr Gordon
&amp; were they sent there—did they remain there &amp; for how long with Major Ball's
consent &amp; knowledge or direction—Did you see him when he came there to order
the Petitioners to the Court House to be seen by a Slave Trader &amp; what did you hear him say at that time?—</p>

<p>Elizth L. Jones did see Major William Ball—at Mount
Sion (the the residence of William Gordon) after Violets return to Virginia—and
while she was in the service of William Gordons Family—and when he went to Mr
Gordons to give orders to
Violet for her self and children to go to
Northumber. Court House Virginia—for
the purpose of shewing them to a slave trader at that place—which circumstance
occurred on or about the 9th of July 1811—When by the
request of Violet—Elizth L.
Jones took upon herself—to make application to Major
Wm Ball—to postpone the disposal
of the woman &amp; her children—until she could get a letter wrote—to her
Master, Henry W. Ball, or until
he arrived in Northum. as was then expected—Major Ball replied to Elizth L.
Jones—that a much longer time had elapsed than he wished
in complying with that request of his brother Henry W. Ball—who had wrote to
him very pressingly to dispose of Violet
and her children—by sale— That for his own part it was a very disagreeable price
of business—to him, and that he wished he had nothing to do with it—But that was
his brother Henry had requested it—that he (Major Ball) hated to refuse him—adding
that—Violet had been very impertinent to Mr. Ball—and that his Brother was very much in a want of the money.—</p>

<p>Major Ball then observed that Violet had no occasion to be contrary about going
to the Court House—that he had given his word to shew her &amp; her children to the
slave trader there—But that he did not think it probable that the man w. give
the price which he sh. require for Violet
and her two children—&gt;Winifred &amp;
Chloe—and seprated his <unclear reason="illegible">finl</unclear> orders—to
her—that her-self and children must go to Northumberland Court
House;——Violet then
collected some articles of clothing <unclear reason="illegible">&amp;cc</unclear> and with her two
children, Winifredand Chloe, left Mount
Sion—then the residence of Mr Gordon—apparently for the purpose
of going to Northum. Court House—agreeable to
the instructions of Major Ball—But the morning following Violets two children being discovered in
Mr. Gordons kitchen—the
presumtion then was—that she did not obey the orders of Major Ball respecting her going to the
Court House—But had some where concealed her self—And in
the course of the same day, which the children of Violet were discovered to be at
Mount Sion—Major Ball sent a servant for them to be carried to his plantation (or mill—),——</p>

<pb xml:id="p003" facs="oscys.case.0030.006.003.jpg"/>

<p>6th. Did you in a conversation with H.W. Ball afterward communicate to him what Major Ball did &amp; said at the time aforesaid
&amp; did he or did he not deny having requested or ordered the said Major Ball to sell the Petitioners.— &amp; Did he
or not deny having sent her &amp; her children to
Virginia to be sold? and what did he say at the time? Did
you mention to him that it was thought or said Violet could not be sold in
Virginia &amp; what did he say, &amp; what did he direct
you to do &amp; how &amp; when did Violet
&amp; her children return to Washington?</p>

<p>In the course of the month of July 1811—and after the
9th (of said month) Henry W. Ball arrived in
Northumberland—and at Mount Sion—(then the residence of
William Gordon) where Elizth L.
Jones then was—who recollects—that the subject
of Violets—being for sale was several
times conversed on by Henry W. Ball and
her-self—Which introduced the subject she does not remember, nor suppose of any
importance—But Elizth L. Jones—certainly related the
distress of Violet (to
(H.W. Ball) when Major Ball ordered her to go to
North. Court House—and also the
part she took in behalf of the sale of Violets being postponed until a letter
could be forwarded or until Henry W. Ball himself sh. arrive in
Northum. and he
did not deny having authorized, or requested, his Brother Major Ball, to dispose
of Violet and her children by sale—and Henry W. Ball stated as his Brother had
before done—that Violet had conducted her-self very unbecomingly to her mistress
(Mrs Ball) to which Elizth L. Jones
replied that Violet could be hired out—if
she did not conduct her-self to the satisfaction of Mrs
Ball—and W. Henry Ball
reply to that was that Violet wd. not
agree to be hired out in the City—Where he had proposed— and it then appeared as if she
was immediately sent down to Northumd and power vested in the hands of Major Ball to dispose of her by sale—But to
whom, or where he was instructed to sell Violet and her children is impossible for
Elizth L. Jones to say—It is more than probable that she
mentioned to Henry W. Ball—the doubts which Mr. Gordon had expressed relative to his
obtaining a sufficient title for Violet and her children—supposing he had
purchased them—and Elizth L Jones is also under the impression that she inquired of W. H
Ball—whether it never occured to him—that Violet could not loyally be disposed of in
Virginia—and to the best of her recollection on
that point—He said he wished to give her a chance of being disposed of in the
neighbourhood of her Husband Emanuel if it could be
done—But did not <unclear reason="illegible">occupy</unclear> him self fully on the subject—Elizth L.
Jones—being interested in the fate of Violet (then <unclear reason="illegible">making</unclear> reference to what W. Ball had said respecting her
not agreeing to be hired out in the City—) observed that
she was concerned now that Violet had
found—some difficulty in getting a resident of Virginia
to purchase her, Her that she wd. be willing to return to Washington and said
all she would to prevail on Mr. Ball to give her another trial.— And after some
days had passed and during Mr. Balls stay at Mount Sion—He told Elizth
L. Jones—that he had some where seen Emanuel
the Husband of Violet (it is necessary to
observe—that Violet still continued to
conceal her-self from the 9th of July) &amp; who
said she wd. make her appearance to her Master—and then w. be willing to return
to the City of Washington—or receive his instructions what she sh do—</p> 

<p>Mr. Ball—did not see Violet as he expected from what
Emanuel had told him—and
upon his leaving North. for the City
of Washington—Mr. Ball requested Elizth L.
Jones—to inform Violet—(shd. she go to
Mount Sion that it was his instructions that she sh.
return to Washington—when Captn <unclear reason="illegible">Masles</unclear> vessel
saild from <unclear reason="illegible">Cane</unclear> River, which was about the latter part
of August—and accordingly Violet—went to
Mount Sion—to receive her Masters orders—which were left
with with Elizth L Jones for her—And Violet said if she could collect some articles
of hers which she wished to carry with her—she shd. go—But the before being
expected to sail that day—Violet did not
get ready to go that opportunity—Nor did Elizth L Jones—see her again, until
October—when she endeavourd to learn where Violet was—And was informed, that she
had been amongst her Husbands relations and had been sick—(Still in
Northd Va)—And why it was any concert of Elzth
Jones's—where Violet
was—as when she wd. leave Northumd. was in consequence of her receiving a letter from H.W. Ball—wherein he requested her—to
make use of her <unclear reason="illegible">enarticles</unclear> to get Violet off as speedily as possible, for
Washington City—And accordingly she left
Northd Virga in the early part of October
1811—agreeable to her Masters instructions which were made known
to her thro. the medium of Elizth L. Jones,——</p>

<pb xml:id="p004" facs="oscys.case.0030.006.004.jpg"/>

<p>7. Did Major Ball while Violet was with his knowledge at Mount
Sion, &amp; before she
concealed herself <del>tell</del> &amp; <del>how long</del> shortly after her return
to Virginia say in your presence and hearing that he had
orders from the Deft to sell her &amp; her children?</p>

<p>Elizth L. Jones does not recollect ever to have heard Major Ball say—until the 9th of July, that he was authorized by
the Deft to sell Violet and her children—, at which time he very decidedly (and
at Mount Sion) informed her that his brother Henry W. Ball had requested him by letter
to dispose of Violet and her children by
sale—adding that a much longer time had elapsed than he wished in complying with
the request of his Brother—as herin &amp; before stated by Elizth L.
Jones—</p>

<p>8. Did Major Ball then or ever acknowledge in your presence &amp; hearing that
proposals had been made between him &amp; Mr Gordon about the sale of Violet—and did you understand from him that it was in consequence of such proposal that she was remaining at Mr Gordon's?</p>

<p>Major Ball was at Mr. Gordons after Violet was there initiated, as a domestic (and
before the 9th of July—) and when she was waiting and passing about the House
without <unclear reason="illegible">reserve</unclear>—And Elizth L. Jones—did not hear Major Ball say any thing about
 at that time to the best of her recollection—</p>
