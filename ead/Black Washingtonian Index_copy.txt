Legal Affairs of Black Washingtonians

Unfortunately, lots of the Circuit Court’s paperwork has disappeared. The docket book for the
December term, 1816, for instance lists a Criminal Trial 2, "US. V. Caleb Simpson...for keeping a
disorderly house, & harbouring slaves on the sabbath," but there are no surviving documents that
relate to the case. There are entire terms of the court for which no petitions for freedom survive.

What follows is a list of cases for which there is at least some documentation extant.

BOX 1 contains miscellaneous early documents, including an arrest warrant for "Negro Ben," who
had run away from Sabrett Scott, and a writ of error for Ben’s wrongﬁil imprisonment.

For the following items, consult the box list.

a Bitch as he was." Another deponent ‘being asked what was the general
Character of the defendant Davis—-answer that he is generally thought to be a

she never had been conquered by an overseer--heard Davis say that the Husband of
Hannah had attempted his life and shewed him marks of violence on his throat."

Apprenticeship ﬁle William Hawley’s petition to be relieved of "John Bush a free coloured
boy" indentured as a house servant, "who has turned out to be idle & mischievous....
Petitioner has tried such means of correction & reformation, as to satisfy him, that not
only his own ease & the good order of his family will be much disturbed by the
continuance of said Boy in his service..., but that the morals & habits of the Boy will
become so lax & deranged, as probably to produce depravity of character in him &
injurious consequences to society.... [I]f the said Indentures be discharged & the Boy
bound again to some steady & industrious mechanic, he may still acquire habits of industry
& good conduct, that will redeem him from the destruction that threatens."
