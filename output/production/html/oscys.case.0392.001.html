That Winny the petitioner, on or about the 1st day of February 1813 was hired by her mistress, then being a resident of the State of Virginia, only the consent and authority of her said Mistress, directly from the State of Virginia into the City of Washington in the District of Columbia, to Walter Jones Jr. of that city, in whose family she remained in the said City, with the knowledge and consent of her Mistress for Twelve Months and <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> more.
