Breast when her husband William Disney bought them, the

William Disney now dead who was the husband of Sarah Disney
the defendant, This deponent has often heard and always understood
that the said Hanah was bought as a slave, as other negroes usually
are, and this deponent never heard untill about the time of the
present Petition or a little before anything to the contrary. This
deponent knows that his nephew William Disney always claimed and
possessed the said Hanah as a slave, and that after the death of
said William his wife Sarah claimed and possessed Hanah and her
Children as slaves, and gave them as slaves to her children. This
deponent has understood that Mrs Sarah Disney changed her religion
and became a Methodist two or three years ago, and since that
time this Deponent has heard of a claim of said Hannah to be free

with the family of his Nephew William for forty years, never

that when the petitioner was small and was offered for sale at the
Inspection house point, one Daniel Brooke went down to the
Vessel and asked the old woman (who was the petitioners Mother
if she and her Children were to be sold, and she answered no
she was not to be sold, as Brooke told her, he then returned to
William Disney's (the defendants husband) and William Disney
asked him where his two little negroes were; he answered he
was not going to buy free negroes, and said she (Hannah's
mother) and her children were as free as he was That a few
days afterwards William Disney went down and bought the
Children, the old woman was gone; William Disney brought them
home and in two days afterwards Joseph Howard came over
and asked William Disney why he bought those two negroes
and said they were free, and as the new England Vessels were
going backwards and forwards they would be known and
taken away; William Disney answered, may be no, they will soon
grow

grow out of knowledge and no one will know they had free
parents. The deponent being asked if he knows Eleanor Barnes
sworn in this cause, answers he does. Being asked her
general Character, answers he does not know much about her,
but believes she keeps low company; and says he has seen
Negroes at her house and laughing and talking with her and
he has seen them setting on her bed. And he further says that
as he was comming from Mill about a month ago he stopped
at Eleanor Barnes's house and she asked the deponent if Hannah
had come home, he answered no, and asked her if she had been to
Court and was sworn, she answered yes; he then asked her
what she had sworn and she replied that she had sworn that
Mrs Disney had told her that she would have set her negroes free long
ago had it not been for her Children he then went on and when
he got home he related to Mrs Disney what had passed, and
she said she did not say so, and if Eleanor Barnes had sworn
that, she swore false. Being asked if he knew what negroes
he had seen at Eleanor Barnes's answers they were the forge negroes
and on Sundays he had seen Strange Negroes but did not
know to whom they belonged. Being asked if Eleanor Barnes

say one thing to day, and if affronted another tomorrow.</p>

Disney went down and bought them both, and when he bought
them home his brother asked him his reason for buying the Children
as they were to serve no longer than until they were twenty one years
of age; he replied he did not care as he gave but a trife for them. Being 
asked of whom he heard such conversation, answers he does not
remember, but that he has frequently heard the same over and over
again from white people; and he has heard Sarah Disney the
defendant say she wished they could be free, and when it come to
the point she would put in a good word for them; and he further
saith that he has heard in the neighbourhood that Sarah Disney the
defendant has said that Hannah was free, but that she could not set
her free, for if she did the Children would fall upon her for the Estate
that had been wasted, but he cannot recollect the persons of whom he
had this information; and he also says that he has always understood

he did not care as he gave but a trifle for them. This he has heard from
them often and first about ten years ago which was about two years
