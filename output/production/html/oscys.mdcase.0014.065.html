<p class="tei_p">To prove that the said Irish Nell was married to a Negro Slave during the existence of the Act passed in 1663/4. entitled An Act concerning Negroes and other Slaves, and to prove that after the said Marriage the said Irish Nell was held as a Slave, and that all the Issue and Descendants from the said Marriage have been Constantly held and Considered as Slaves, and that the Present Petitioner one of the Descendants aforesaid, has been always held and considered as a Slave by the Defendant. To which Evidence so offered by the Defendant the Present Petitioners Counsel Objected; alleging that a Record of the Conviction of the said Irish Nell for having intermaried with the said Slave should be produced, and that without such Conviction neither the said Irish Nell nor any of her Descendants could legally be slaves, whereupon the Court gave the following Opinion. That without a Conviction in a Court of Record of Irish Nell's having intermarried with a Slave, she could not become a Slave, nor could her Issue become Slaves by Virtue of such Intermarriges. That no Presentation of such Conviction arises from the Petitioner and her Ancestors having been always held in Slavery.</p>

That no Length of Possession of the said Irish Nell and her Descendants from the said Marriage as Slaves, nor any of the Facts related in any of the Depositions taken in the said former Cause are sufficient to satisfy the Court of such Conviction.
