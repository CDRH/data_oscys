<p>Fanny<br/>
v<br/>
Kell</p>

<p>agreement of counsel</p>

<p>The Petitioners acquired no legal right to freedom. If they are entitled in Equity can they recover in this form of action? Does a voluntary promise to emancipate give an equitable claim? Will equity enforce a <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> pact? Is there any <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> moral obligation to <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> which will stand in the place of a consideration? Can any contract between master &amp; slave give a Right either at law or in equity?</p>
