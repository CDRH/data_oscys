Your Orator will state to your honors that it will be utterly impossible for him to pay at the rate of $120. per annum for the support of his wife without selling property every year for

<p class="tei_p">Whereupon he determined to appeal from the decree of your honors in said suit for maintenance and accordingly did so with the effect of the said decree having been reversed by the Court of Appeals, your Orator will further state that upon the said information having been given him he did forthwith come to the conclusion that his said wife should not live apart from him if he could help it, as he could not hesitate in the choice to submit to her complaints and discontent and whatever other annoyance he might be subjected to by the acerbity of her temper rather than submit to utter ruin as he had a numerous offspring and was old himself and getting to be infirm and approaching the age of helplessness and infirmity. That thereupon he went to his said wife and requested her to go home and live with him, promising to be as kind to her as possible and to protect and maintain her at home and urging the necessity of her going home as it was utterly out of his power to afford her a Separate Maintenance as it was with the utmost difficulty that he could support his Family at home and assuring her that she should not be interfered with by any body.

That thereupon he publickly advertised in a News Paper in the City of Washington the National Intelligencer, that his wife had left him and that he forbid all person from harbouring her, in the hope that she would thus be driven to the necessity of returning home to live with him, which she however still persisted in refusing to do. Your Orator further states that when he afterwards heard of the reversal of the said Decree of your honors and was informed by his Counsel that he was thereby restored to all his natural rights, he again called upon his said wife and requested her to come live with him promising her again protection and kindness which she still refused to do and on the contrary at the next Term of your Honl. Court thereafter filed another Petition in your Honl. Court praying for alimony your Orator should pay to his said wife $120. per annum quarterly during the pendencies of the said suit, your Orator will further state that he has almost reduced to ruin by the necessity of paying that annuity and that he can see no certain prospect of an end to that suit, that his said wife has still retained the said property which he gave to her by virtue of the said agreement and that the said Negro Girl has now become a woman and has two children all of whom with the Mother are worth $450.
