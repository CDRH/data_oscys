<p class="tei_p">A Statement of the facts &amp; circumstances in the Case of James a negro man who petitions <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">&amp; sue[?]</span> for his freedom</p>

<p class="tei_p">It appears That the said negro James was owned by a certain William Brogdin an inhabitant of the state of Maryland, that the said James came into the District of Columbia &amp; County of Alexandria without the consent of his said master. That in the month of September year 1800 the said Wm. Brogdin took possession of the sd. negor James &amp; committed him to the care of Jame Campbell of Alexandria where the sd. James has remained ever since by direction of his sd master &amp; for more than twelve months. &amp; that the negro James is now in possession of the sd Jas Campbell</p>

<p class="tei_p">Upon the above statement of facts, I am of opinion that the sd. negro James is intitled to his freedom, his case coming clearly within the intents &amp; meaning of the act of assembly.</p>
