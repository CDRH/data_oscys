vs.<br/>
William H. Williams</p>

<p class="tei_p">Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for the County of Washington.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Petition for Freedom.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Be it remembered that on the first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty, Judgment by the said Court was rendered against the Defendant in the above cause, as appears from the minutes and proceedings of said Court.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Whereupon the said Defendant by John Marbury Esquire his Attorney filed in Court here the following petition, which appears to have been addressed to the Honorable Roger B. Taney Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the words &amp; off the tenor following, to wit:</p>



<p class="tei_p">To the Honorable the Ch. Justice of the United States of America</p>

<p class="tei_p">The petition of William H. Williams of Washington City in the District of Columbia, respectfully shews. That in the month of December last he purchased from Gerrard T. Greenfield, a negro man named James Ash, with notice that the said Greenfield claimed the said negro under the will of Maria A. Greenfield, late of Prince Georges County, Maryland, deceased, and that the said Maria had, by a proviso in her will restricted the <del>sai</del> right of said Gerrard to any one or to reserve him from the State of Maryland, a restriction

<span class="tei_fw_type_pageNum tei_fw">2</span>

which she in like manner imposed upon the said Gerrard as legatee of sixteen other negroes in her said will. Your petitioner was also informed that the said Gerrard had been advised that such restriction upon the right to dispose of the property given him by the said will, being repugnent to the nature of the estate given, was void, and that his object in selling the negro James Ash was to obtain a Judicial decision on that question. the negro James was therefore informed of the sale and an opportunity given him to commence a suit for his freedom. Your petitioner was fully indemnified in the event of a decision in favour of the freedom of the said negro.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Your petitioner further shews that the said negro James did commence his said suit, and the same was tried at the term of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for Washington County <del>whi</del> <del>on finding</del> which closed its sittings on Friday the 1st of this month, and the judgment of the said Court in said cause being against your petitioner, be, feeling himself agrieved thereby, did pray an Appeal, but in as much as the said negro is not of the value of one thousand dollars your petitioner cannot have the benefit of his appeal without an order from one of the Justices of the Supreme Court <del>directed</del> directing the same to be allowed. Your petitioner therefore believing that there is error in the judgment of the said Circuit Court in the said cause, and that such error involves a question of law,

important to the slave states, and therefore of such <del>important</del> extensive interest as to render a final decision of the same by the Supreme Court of the United States desirable, respectfully lays before your Honor a copy of the proceedings complained of, and prays, that the same may be considered, and that your Honor would direct such order to the Clerk of the said Circuit Court as will enable your petitioner to reverse the said cause by appeal to the Supreme Court. &amp; he will pray.</p>

<p class="tei_p">And your petitioner asks leave to suggest the following as a sufficient cause why such order should be allowed.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That in the decision of the case of James Ash, the Circuit Court have held virtually that the rule of law which would have been applied in the trial often right to any other property inapplicable to a case in which the right of a negro to freedom was involved, it having been conceeded on all hands, that if the bequest had related to other than negro property with a devise over in case of sale or removal, the devise over would have been void as depending on a repugnant condition. Or if Maria A. Greenfield had, instead of giving freedom to the negroes, in the event of their being sold or removed, given them in such event to some third person that the devise over would have been void for the same reason.</p>

<p class="tei_p">In addition to which your petitioner may suggest that the value of the property
