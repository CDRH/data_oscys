and enjoining the said Bernard H. Buckner and Aris Buckner their agents and Attorneys from removing you Petitioner from the County and District aforesaid, in manner and form aforesaid; and also commanding the said Marshal to detain and keep in his custody and not to deliver up to the said Bernard H. Buckner and Aris Buckner their agents and attorney, your Petitioner, till the further order of this Court, and such further relief in the premises as his case may require, and as in duty bound your Petitioner will ever pray, &amp; so forth.</p>
