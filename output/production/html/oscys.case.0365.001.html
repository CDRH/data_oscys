<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">Your petitioner Jacob begs leave to state unto your Worships that he being a slave, the property of Mrs. Etherton some time in the year     he was sold by her to a certain Mr. Hamilton who was at that time an inhabitant of the state of Maryland. That some time in the year 1783 he was bought into this state and sold by the said Hamilton to a certain Samuel Earl, and that by different sales and transfers he at length got into the possession of Doctor Stephen Cooke, who has ever since held him in Slavery. Your Petitioner further represents that the said Hamilton failed to take the oath prescribed by the Act of Assembly <del>passessed</del> passed in the year 1778 providing for the preservation of the titles of owners of slaves importing them from Maryland or any other state, into this state. By reason of which failure your Petitioner is advised that he is entitled to his freedom. Wherefore he prays that he may be allowed to sue in forma pauperis for the same.</p>
