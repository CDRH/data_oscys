<p class="tei_p">A writ of error is not a <em class="tei_term">supersedeas</em>, unless a copy of it be lodged for the adverse

<p class="tei_p">Habeas corpus <em class="tei_term">ad subjiciendum</em>. The <em class="tei_term">mittimus</em> returned, was
in the following form, viz.</p>

<p class="tei_p">"District of Columbia. County of Washington, ss. Whereas
it is represented by Sabret Scott to the subscriber, a justice of the
peace, that his negro, Ben, has run away from his service, and
otherwise treated him ill, and fears that the said negro Ben will
run away again, and therefore prays a commitment for safe keeping:
These are therefore to authorize and require you to receive
the said Ben, and him safe keep in your jail until his said master
releases him therefrom, or he be otherwise legally discharged.
Given under my hand and seal this 23d day of March, 1809.
(Signed.) John Ott. (L.S.) The marshal of the District of
Columbia."</p>
   
<p class="tei_p">Mr. F. S. Key, for the prisoner, contended that he was free by
the judgment of this Court, rendered on the 19th of June, 1807,
and that the writ of error did not suspend the judgment. The
citation was not served until January 12th, 1808. No copy of
the writ of error was lodged in the office of the clerk, for the
master, as required by the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">23d section of the Judiciary Act of
1789, [1 Stat. at Large, 73.]</span> It was no <em class="tei_term">supersedeas</em> to the execution,
because no execution could issue. The judgment of the
Court only ascertained the right of the negro to his freedom.
The effect of the <em class="tei_term">supersedeas</em> is only to stay the execution, not to
suspend the judgment.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Jones, contrà. The writ of error was left in the office
within the ten days, viz., on the 22d of June, 1807, and while it
remained there, no copy was necessary for the adverse party.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court, then consisting of Cranch, C. J., and Fitzhugh,
J., being divided in opinion, the prisoner was remanded.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.report.0001.004.002.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%252Foscys.report.0001.004.002.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.report.0001.004.002.jpg/full/!150,150/0/default.jpg" class="display &#xA;              "/></a></span>

<p class="tei_p">But at June term, 1809, the prisoner was brought up again by
habeas corpus, and the Court being full he was discharged, the
Court (Fitzhugh, J., contrà,) being of opinion that the writ of
error could not be served so as to be a <em class="tei_term">supersedeas</em>, unless a copy
thereof should be lodged in the clerk's office for the adverse party
within ten days after the judgment.</p>
