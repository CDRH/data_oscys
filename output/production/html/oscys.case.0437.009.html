<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">To the Honorable Chief Justice Taney.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The petition of Richard B. Alexander humbly represents that at March term 1840 of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, for the county of Washington, on a petition for freedom filed by Moses Graham against the said Richard B. Alexander, complaining of illegal detention in slavery, judgment was rendered for the said Richard B. Alexander, but not as full and complete a judgment as ought in law have been rendered in the case, as will more fully appear by a copy of the record and proceedings in the said cause and hereto annexed. And the said Richard B. Alexander assigns error as follows:</p>

<p class="tei_p">The first fact the jury find in the special verdict (bearing on the point in error) is, "that Miss Brown sold Milly and her two children to Mrs. Alexander, she to be free at 31, and her children then, born and then afterwards to be born, at the same age." They further find that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age." Upon a reference, however, to the will of Miss Brown (in the transcript of the proceedings) it will be found that the petitioner (Moses Graham) is not mentioned or referred to; is not emancipated by any possibility of construction which the court could, by law, give to the instrument.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Now the error assigned by the defendant is in the erroneous application of the law to the above facts. The <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">law of Virginia 1792 Chap. 103, Section 36</span> (and applicable to this case) provides that slaves shall be emancipated either by last will and testament or by deed recorded in the county or corporation court. Any other method of emancipation is void.</p>

<p class="tei_p">As such is the law, the fact found by the jury, that "Milly" (mother of the petitioner) "and her children, were sold to Mrs. Alexander, to be free as they should respectively arrive at the age of 31 years" does not amount to such an emancipation as the law requires. The fact found by the jury that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be, that they were to be free at 31 years of age" is an encroachment on the province of the court, whose duty it is to decide as to the import and construction of last wills and testaments. it will be found upon a reference to this will, that the petitioner (Moses) is not mentioned in such will, is not referred to by the testatrix, that there is not the remotest implication by which his freedom can be effected.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Notwithstanding the said will does not emancipation the petitioner, and although the law peremptorily requires the emancipation

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.case.0437.009.004.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%252Foscys.case.0437.009.004.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.case.0437.009.004.jpg/full/!150,150/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

to be by deed or last will and testament, the court gives to the petitioner his freedom at the age of 31 years.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The error above assigned involves a question of law, of extensive interest, both public and private—of a public interest, since it admits the reception of parol evidence to explain and enlarge the meaning of a will, to give to a last will and testament a different meaning from that which the words in themselves evidently and necessarily imply—of a private interest to the defendant, since there are several other slaves having similar claims, in whose favour similar verdicts would be found, and which verdicts would be construed by the court, as having a similar legal effect and operation, unless the Supreme Court shall reverse so erroneous a decision.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Wherefore, your petitioner prays that your honor will issue an order to the clerk of the said court, directing him to issue a writ of error under the terms and conditions prescribed by law in all such cases, and as in duty bound he will ever pray.<br/>
Swann &amp; Swann,<br/>
Attorneys.</p>

<p class="tei_p">On the back of the aforegoing petition was the following order to wit:</p>

<p class="tei_p">I have read and considered the within petition of Richard B. Alexander, the defendant in the within mentioned case, and also the proceedings of the circuit court therein referred to, and complained of by the petitioner, a copy of which proceedings accompanies this petition, and being of opinion that the errors assigned and relied on, involve questions of law of such extensive interest and operation, as to render the final decision of them by the Supreme Court desirable, I do hereby direct the clerk of Washington county to issue the writ of error as prayed for, upon the terms and conditions in such cases prescribed by law.<br/>
R. B. Taney.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Whereupon, in pursuance of the above order a writ of error issued, and a citation, directed to the said Moses Graham as follows, to wit:</p>

<p class="tei_p">The United States of America, ss.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The President of the United States, to the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, sitting for the County of Washington, greeting:</p>

<p class="tei_p">who being duly empannelled and sworn to say the truth in the premises, upon their oath, do say:</p>

<p class="tei_p">Special Verdict.</p>

<p class="tei_p">We find, that the petitioner is the son of Milly who was the slave of Miss Brown, who resided in Georgetown about the year 1790 and for two or three years afterwards, with her sister Mrs. Magruder, that she afterwards lived with the same sister in Maryland, and, and afterwards, but not before 1806, with her sister Mrs. Alexander in Alexandria county; that during all this time the petitioner's mother and grandmother belonged to Miss Brown, who sometime about the year 1813, while she was living with Mrs. Alexander, brought Milly from Washington county where she had been living, hired out by her mistress for one or two years, to Mrs. Alexander, in Alexandria county.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That Milly then had two female children, and that the petitioner was born afterwards, and while Milly was at Mrs. Alexander's. That Mr. Brown on bringing her to Mrs. Alexander's sold Milly and her two children to Mrs. Alexander, she to be free at 31, and her children then born, and those afterward to be born, at the same age.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That the petitioner was held by Mrs. Alexander during her life, and by her administrator the present defendant since, not as a slaver for life, but as entitled to freedom at 41 years of age.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That Miss Brown died in 1825 making her last will and testament (copied in page 20).</p>

<p class="tei_p">That Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of said negroes to her sister to be, that they were to be free at 31 years of age.</p>

<p class="tei_p">And that the petitioner will be on the 25th of December, 1839, twenty-six of age.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That Miss Brown sent an officer for Milly to Georgetown, where she was then residing, and from whence she was brought in 1813 to her sister with the intention to sell her and her children to her sister, and did thereupon sell her as before stated on the terms and conditions stated in her will.</p>

<p class="tei_p">And that said Milly was kept in Alexandria county from the time of her said importation till she became 31 years of age, when she was suffered to go free and is free now. And the petitioner was so kept in said county till the filing of this petition.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That Miss Brown when she had the said Milly and her two children brought into Alexandria county, or at any time before or afterwards, did not take the oath required by the 4th Section of 17th December 1792. And if upon the facts aforesaid, the law be for the petitioner, we find for the petitioner, and if otherwise we find for the defendant.<br/>
