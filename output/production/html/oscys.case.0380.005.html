<p class="tei_p">From the affidavits furnished the undersigned, he states that it appears the petitioner in the year 1790 belonged to Elizabeth Marle then a resident of the State of Maryland, &amp; that some time in that year the said Elizabeth Marle removed to the town of Alexandria, then in the Commonwealth of Virginia. That when the said Elizabeth removed to the said Commonwealth, she failed to take the oath prescribed by the Laws of Virginia, respecting the importation of slaves. It appears negro Amie Continued more than one year in the state of Virginia</p>

<p class="tei_p">It appears she is now claimed as a slave by Hanson Reno, of the County of Alexandria, under colour of a bill of sale and assignment, the execution of which on the part of the said Elizabeth Marle, is denied by his affidavit.</p>
