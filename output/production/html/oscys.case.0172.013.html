<p class="tei_p">I state that the foregoing proof in substance has ben discovered through the directions given by myself, and by active exertions of which the Petitioner had no knowledge, and I have seen witnesses, and their evidence to prove each one of the said facts, except one, that at present depends upon hearsay, but I have good cause to believe and do believe it can be proved by living witnesses. I have the evidence of that fact from the statements made by two witnesses now dead, there are other said to be living.</p>
