said county, for one whole year thereafter, or so long at different times as amount to one year, before the bringing of this action, then the plaintiff is entitled to his freedom, although the jury should be satisfied that he was the property of the defendant, at the time he was so brought in, and that the defendant took the oath on the 5th of July, as stated in the certificate.</p>
