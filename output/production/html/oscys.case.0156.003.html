<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">And <del>the</del> Orrin Davis comes into Court here in his own proper person and prays judgment of the Court upon the said writ issued in this cause because he says that the said writ was served upon this defendant whose name is Orrin and not Irrine, and that he supposes the same was intended for to mean this deponent although he was baptized by the name of Orrin and not Irrine (to wit <del>at the County of Washington in the District of Columbia</del>) and by that name is called and known, and by the same name from the time of his baptism hitherto both been named and called: without this that he the said Orrin Davis now is or ever was called or known by the name of Irrine Davis as by the said writ is above supposed. And this he is ready to verify wherefore he saith that the said Court here ought not to take nor will take cognizance of the said plea against him in this Court.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Orrin Davis being duly sworn deposes and says that the facts in the foregoing plea set forth and contained are true as therein set forth</p>
