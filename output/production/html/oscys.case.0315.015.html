<p class="tei_p">Be it Remembered, that on the trial of this Cause the Petitioner gave in evidence the following extract from the Will of John B. Kirby deceased.</p>

<p class="tei_p">"Item, it is my Will that all my slaves, that are over the age of thirty five years, shall be free immediately after my death; and all my slaves, that are under the age of Thirty five years shall serve, the males till they arrive to the age of thirty five, the females to the age of Thirty years; after

which respective ages, they and each of them shall be free, and my Executor is accordingly authorized by proper deeds in writing to execute this clause of my Will. should any of my female slaves have children during their period of service as aforesaid, it is my Will that the male children serve until they are thirty five and the females until they are thirty years of age, and then be free, and in all cases of future female descendants, the males shall never serve beyond thirty five nor the females beyond Thirty years of age, and then in all cases they shall for ever after be free."</p>

<p class="tei_p">Talbert, a Witness for Petitioner then testified that a few days after the death of said Kirby, which took place in the year 1828 George Naylor brought to his house, where Witness was then at work the Petitioner, &amp; her Mother and Sister, and said George Naylor stated to Witness at the time that he had brought said Negroes from the residence of the said Kirby and that the Petitioner was then between six and eight years of age.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Petitioner then offered to prove that her Brother Richard, and her Mother Sarah and her Sister Eliza had obtained their freedom under the said Will. The two latter by suits, one bought by Sarah in 1835 in which

judgment was rendered in 1838 which was defended by said Geo. Naylor, who claimed to own said Negro Woman Sarah, and that Eliza brought to the March term of the Court of 1840 and in which judgment was obtained against the defendant in 1842, and that is very unusual for slaves of the age of Petitioner at the time of Kirby's death to be separated from their Parents, but the Court excluded this testimony from the Jury, to which decision of the Court refusing to admit this testimony, the Petitioner by her Counsel at the time excepted.</p>

<p class="tei_p">On the part of the Defendant his brother Naylor and his niece Mrs Tolson testified that they had known the Petitioner from her birth, that she was born the Slave of said George Naylor, that they had been in the habit of seeing her almost daily, and they had never known her to be out of the possession of George Naylor in his life time or of his Administrator the defendant since his death.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court at the request of the Petitioner instructed the Jury as follows.</p>

<p class="tei_p">If the Jury believe from the evidence that the Negroes were in possession of Kirby at the date of his death, that is evidence of Ownership, provided that possession is unexplained, unless upon the whole evidence, the Jury shall think such possession was without claim of title.
