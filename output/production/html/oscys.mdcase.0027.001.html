<p class="tei_p">And now here at this day to wit the 10th day of October Anno Dom. 1721 Comes the said
Ruth Howard by Thomas Bordley her attorney in to his Lordships Provinciall Court
of Maryland before the Justices thereof and Saith that in the Record and Process
afd as alsoe in the Rendering the Judgement afd tis Manifestly Err'd to wit in this</p>

<p class="tei_p">Imps. That the Court having taken upon them to make a Negroe which is by Act of Assembly
of this Province declared a Slave for Life to become free at Twenty five years
of Age Contrary <del>Contrary</del> to the Express words of the same Act and to the great
Annoyance of his Majestys Christian Subjects within this province by allowing these
Africans the Enjoyment of Liberty &amp; of Previledges Equal to those of Englishmen 
whereas the Royall Charter of this province granted by his Majestys
Progenitors to those of the Lord Propry appears to have been for the planting
an Ample Colony of the English Nation in these parts.</p>

<p class="tei_p"><span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Is[?]</span> In this that the Court Declared the reason of Setting her free was because it seemed 
to them it was the Design of her former Mistress Anne Lambert that She Should
be free &amp;t but that it appears not that the said Anne Lambert had Executed these
designes whilst it was in her Power to have rendered them Effectuall Nor that 
Ever she designed to set her free before she Disposed of her to the said Ruth Nor that
the said Negroe was set free or designed to be set free by her Mistress for that
time being but by her former Mistress whose Power was Determined.</p>

<p class="tei_p"><span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Is[?]</span> In this that the said Court ought to have given Judgment against the said Bess
that She Should Continue a Slave and not that She Should be free at twenty five
years of Age for all which and many Other Errors in the Record and Process
afd the said Ruth Howard prays that that Judgment be reverst and that She to
all that She thereby Lost may be restored that the said Bess to the Errors 
afd may Rejoyn and that the Court will proceed to Examine the same according
to Law &amp;t</p>

<p class="tei_p">Whereupon the said Negro Bess in her proper person
appears and Says that in the Record and proceedings and also in the 
rendering Judgement therein it is in no thing Erred and prays that the same
Judgment may in all things be affirmed &amp;t and there upon as well the said
Negroe Bess as the said Ruth Howard by her attorney afd pray the Court of
the Lord Propry here will proceed as well to the Examining of the Record
and proceedings afd as of the Matters above for Errors assigned &amp;t.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Whereupon for that the Court here are not advised of their Judgment of
and upon the premises day is given to the said parties to hear thereof
their <del>Jug</del> Judgment untill next Court for that the said Court as yet are not &amp;t</p>

<p class="tei_p">At which said next Court to wit the 10th day of Anno Dom 1722 Comes again in as well
the said Ruth Howard by her attorney afd as the said Negro Bess in her <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_incomplete tei_gap_reason_image tei_gap">[incomplete image]</span>

Dom 1722 afd that the Judgment afd for the Errors afd be reversed
Annulled and altogether held for None and that the said Ruth Howard
