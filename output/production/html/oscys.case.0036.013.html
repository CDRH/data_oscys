<p class="tei_p">It is also admitted that the said John Thompson died some time in the year     180     making his will duly executed &amp; recorded (a copy whereof is herewith exhibited) It is also admitted that the widow of said Testator had no child born after the Testator's death and that she, after his death, &amp; within the time limitted by law made in due form a renunciation of her claims under the said will.</p>
 
<p class="tei_p">It is further admitted that the said Testator <span class="tei_gap_extent_three tei_gap_extent_lines tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span></p>

<p class="tei_p">It is also admitted that the Child Sarah Anne has been born of the said Nelly since the death of the Testator &amp; during the period of servitude of her mother. It is also further admitted that the Deft claims the Petitioners under the said Testator's widow, who took them claiming that, in consequence of her renunciation of the will, she was entitled to one third of all her husbands personal assets not excluding the said negroes. and that the said Petrs do not exceed what would be the widow's thirds of Testator's negroes, if these negroes are not to be excluded.</p>
 
<p class="tei_p">Upon this statement it is submitted to the Court to decide whether the claim of the negroes under the will can be overthrown by the widow's renouncing it &amp; whether the said child born in the time of her mother's servitude is a slave for life, or bound to serve at all, or how long.</p>
