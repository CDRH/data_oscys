That he has heard his father say he was a Joiner by Trade and worked at the Wood Yard where the said Darnall <del>then</del> lived, and he has often heard him say that he knew a Woman by the name of Joyce, she was a black woman, and was born as his father was informed in Barbadoes, that some of the family went to England and that the then Lord Baltimore brought her <del>into England</del> with him to Maryland in the Character of a Cook or waiting maid, she was called after she came to Maryland Lord Baltimores Cook, she was a young woman when she came in as Deponants father informed him: that his father did about the year seventeen hundred and seventy six and was in his ninetieth year when he died; that this

conversation he has often heard his father recite: and he has heard his father say she had four sons, one called Tom Crane, <del>the other</del> one called Frank, the other called David the name of the fourth he can't recollect; he cannot recollect the Sirnames of any but Crane, he understood they took their Sir Names from their fathers, and had different Sir Names.

<p>This deponant further saith that his father told him he knew the four sons of Joyce and he knew the woman who was called Joyce and that he had worked sundry times at the Woodyard. And he has heard his Uncle David Davis say that it was the report of the neighbourhood, that if she had justice done her she ought to have been free; and this he has

heard sundry times from his Uncle when talking the matter over. That his said Uncle has been dead many years. That he understood from his father that he had heard Mr Darnall say that Joyce came in with Lord Baltimore and that she was <del>17</del> about 17 or 18 years old when she came in and that she was left with Mr Darnall by Lord Baltimore when he returned to England.</p>
