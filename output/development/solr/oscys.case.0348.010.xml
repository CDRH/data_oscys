John. C. Henry (seal) Brice J. Goldsborough (seal) Ezekiel Richardson Esqr: Clerk of Dorchester County Court, and above twenty one years of age, after having taken the proper oath, answered the following interrogatories in the manner herein ordered. 1st Interrogatory. Do you know, whether or not, Lotty the party petitioner named in the annexed commission, was at any time the slave of a certain Daniel Parker of this County? Answer. I do not. 2nd Intr: Is there any record in the clerk's office of this county illustrative of the mode by which James Condon formerly of this county became possessed of this negro Lotty? Ans: There is not. Intr: 3rd Is there any deed of manumission from Daniel Parker, or from any other person, to negro Lotty recorded in your office? Ans: There is not. There is a deed of manumission from George Stanley to negro Rachel Stanly who, I am told, is the mother of Lotty, executed the sixteenth day of February seventeen hundred and ninety two. There is none to Lotty. Intr 4. Are you in possession of any facts or can you designate any person who can make known any facts, tending to establish that claim to freedom which Lotty has asserted in a court of law? Ans: I am in possession of no facts and I know of no person in possession of such facts. Intr: 5th If you have any further intelligence on this subject declare the same as fully as if you were specialy interrogated? Ans: I have no further intelligence. E Richardson William Reed Deputy Register of Wills for Dorchester county and above twenty one years of age, after he had taken the annexed oath answered the following questions in the manner exclaimed. Intr: 1st Was or was not Lotty, who is the petitioner in the annexed commission, formerly the slave of Daniel Parker late of Dorchester County? Ans: I have always been told so; but I have no legal intelligence on the subject. Intr: 2nd Is not the said Daniel Parker now deceased, and when was the inventory of his personal estate returned to the appropriate office? Ans: Daniel Parker is dead; and his inventory was returned to the Register's office in the year eighteen hundred and one. Intr: 3rd Is or is not the name of Rachel the mother of Lotty or is the name of Lotty any where to be found in the inventory of the said deceased's personal estate or is the name of either mentioned in the last will and testament of the said Daniel Parker? Ans: The name of Rachel or Lotty is neither mentioned in the inventory or will of Daniel Parker Inter: 4th Was or was not James Condon living in this county at the time of Daniel Parker's death; and had James Condon possession of negro Lotty at that time? Ans: James Condon was living in this county at the time of D. Parker's death; and I find by reference to the books of the Commissioners of Tax for this County that James Condon was assesed in the year 1804 with a negro girl slave for life; I do not know whether that slave was called Lotty. Intr: 5th Are you not clerk to the Commissioners of the Tax for this county? Ans: I am. Intr: 6th Was or was not Daniel Parker at any time assesed with a negro slave called Lotty? Ans: There is no evidence appearing on the Books of his paying tax for a slave called Lotty. Intr: 7th Was or was not James Condon at any time assesed with a female negro slave for life during the last year he remained in this county? Ans: He was assesed with a female negro slave for life and with no other of any description. Intr: 8th Do you know any person or any fact that can aid Lotty in the establishment of her claim to freedom; if you do, now declare the same? Ans: I know no person or fact which can lend her any assistance. William Reed John Mowbray of Dorchester County and above twenty one years of age after having been duly sworn answered the following interrogatories in the manner as herein declared: Intr: 1st Did you ever know James Condon formerly of Dorchester County; if yea, at what time and how long? Ans: In the year 1798 or there about seventeen hundred and ninety eight I became the apprentice of James Condon and remained an inmate of his family till the spring of eighteen hundred and five. Intr: 2nd During the lapse of this time had Condon any slave or slaves in his family or elsewhere? Ans: During this time James Condon has in his family one negro slave called Lotty Stanley. He had no other slave at any except a negro boy whom he owned a short time. Inter 3rd. How old was Lotty at the time James Condon first got possession of her; and how old was she when Condon left this County? Ans: When I went to live with James Condon I found in his family negro Lotty and I do not know how long she had previously lived there. When Condon left this State Lotty was about between fourteen and sixteen. Inter 4th Do you know from whom and in what manner James Condon became possessed of negro Lotty? Ans: I have always understood and believed that she was purchased of Daniel Parker; for what time I know not. Intr: 5th Do you know the name of Lotty's mother? Ans: I have always heard and believed that she was daughter of Rachel Stanley th once the slave of Daniel Parker. Intr 6th. Can you in any manner render Lotty any assistance in sustaining her alleged right to freedom; if you can fully make known the same? Ans: I know nothing which will avail in the prosecution of her suit. While in Condon's family I have frequently heard Mrs: Condon say, at times when a little provoked with Lotty's conduct, that she (Lotty) should not be free so soon as Lotty expected. I have also heard in Condons family that Lotty was promised her freedom; whether by James Condon, his wife, or Daniel Parker I do not know. Intr: 7th When James Condon was about to leave this State was or was or wa not that fact generally known; and was or was not the further fact known that he intended to carry with him this negro Lotty; and any efforts made to arrest her? Ans: It was a fact notorious that Condon was about to leave this state and carry with him negro Lotty; and I heard no objection at that time nor since, till the institution of the present suit. John Mowbary William Flint of Dorchester County and above twenty years of age after having been duly sworn answered the following intterogatories in the manner as here declared: In: 1st Did you ever know James Condon formerly of Dorchester County; if yea, when and how long? Ans: I did know him from the year seventeen hundred and ninety seven till the spring of eighteen hundred and five: when he left the state. Intr: 2nd During this lapse of time had Condon any slave or slaves in his family or elsewhere? Ans: During this time I lived under the same roof with Condon and he had no slave except negro Lotty who lived in his family. Intr: 3rd How old was Lotty when Condon left here for the Western County? Ans: She was about eighteen years old. I knew her well she was grown to a woman some years before he left the state. Intr: 4th Do you know from whom and in what manner James Condon became possessed of negro Lotty? Ans: James Condon purchased her of Daniel Parker as a slave for life. I will recollect that she was purchased a slave for life and at a price at that time considered high. Intr: 5th At the time Condon left here did he go off privately or was that fact known? Ans: It was known six months before he left here that he intended to go to the western county and it was also known by all persons that he intended to take with him negro Lotty. Intr: 6th Was there not at the time several members of the Abolition Society living in and about Cambridge and did they not know that he intended to leave the state and cary with him negro Lotty and did any one of them make any effort to arrest her going? Ans: There were several members of that society living in and about Cambridge and I presume they, as well others, knew that he intended to carry with him negro Lotty, and I never heard that she was not a slave for life till the institution of this suit. I am entirely certain that James Condon purchased Lotty a slave for life William Flint 11th December 1827. We certify that we have made the several interrogatories to Ezekiel Richardson, Wm Rea. John Mowbray &amp; Wm. Flint as above exhibited &amp; their answers are severally truly stated. In Testimony whereof we have hereunto set our Hands &amp; seals Jno.
