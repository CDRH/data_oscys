That on the day or the Saturday before he went to the Alms House, he sent for a neighbor to borrow a carriage in which to ride there, and that neighbor called to see him, and in the presence of his wife had a conversation with him, in which he informed the neighbor that he would have a large chest to carry, and she declined to let him have the carriage, that the defendant being present at this conversation expressed his objections to his going to the Alms house, but said as he had made up his mind to go, he could go.
