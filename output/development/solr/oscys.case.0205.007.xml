Because said Rachael Wallingsford was the wife of the Defendant at the time of executing the same and as femme coverte could not execute said deed, sd deed Because said deed so made by said Rachael gave to the Petitioners, who were at the time of it's execution the slaves of the defendant Petitioners no rights of claims to their freedom, and to maintain said life. The Defendant then proved by James Meade, a considerable competent witness, that he had been acquainted with Defendant and his wife Rachael Wallingsford who execute said Deed for a long time. The he has known them for more than 30 years that he knew them before their marriage and ever since, until the day of Rachael Wallingsford death, which took place a short time before the present suit was brought and at the House of the Defendant her husband; That he was not at the wedding but saw them a day or two after at Defendants House and has known them intimately, as man &amp; wife, ever since; that he cannot say how long they since they are married, but it has been many years. That Sarah Ann Allen one of the Petitioners and mother to the others, was born the slave of the Defendant and that he has known her as such ever since. That Defendant has claimed said Sarah since her birth and has all her children as his slaves; That Rachael Wallingsford the wife of the Defendant and the same who executed said deed, voluntarily left her husbands House about the year 1819 or 1820, as well as Witness recollects, and took Sarah Ann with her to wait on her; that whilst Rachael remained with her husband Sarah Ann used to wait on her and be about the house; that Witness does not know why Rachael went away from her Husband; that she never had a fixed home after this, but lived about with her acquaintances in Prince George's County, in Maryland where Defendant resided, staying with first one and then the other and at times returning to her Husband's, and at other times going for a short time to Washington City to see her acquaintances there and then returning to Prince George's again; that she never did remain or fix her residence in Washington City; that Rachael sometimes had the negroes (Petitioners) with her in Prince George's and sometimes in Washington City. That He also understood from both Defendant and his wife, that Defendant permitted her to take said negroes with her to wait on her only, as his wife. That at times, during all this time, the Defendant and said Rachael his wife, would be friendly together for a short time when a disturbance would take place; that his wife (Defendants) appeared always apprehensive, when then quarrels took place, that Defendant would take said Sarah Ann &amp; children from her, and from the day she first took her (Sarah Ann) said Rachael was in the habit of concealing and hiding said Sarah Ann from Defendant and of for that purpose would often bring her to Washington City; that Witness was the particular and intimate friend of both Defendant and his wife, the latter staying often with him, after she left her Husband, for months at a time, at his residence in Prince George's County Maryland; that said Rachael was much more in Prince George County than in Washington City and that she only went backwards and forwards from the one place to the other; that her conduct in so doing gave Defendant great unhappiness and distress of mind; that Defendant, to Witnesses knowledge, often entreated her to return and live with him as a wife ought to do and she always refused so to do; that this state of things produced great unhappiness with Defendant; that Defendant had been married before and had lost his wife, by whom he had several children; that said Rachael was his second wife and they had no children. That in the year 1827, Defendant came to Washington City to take possession of Petitioners and to carry them home, having heard that they were concealed there, that Witness was with him; that they took Petitioners and when taking them away, said Rachael made oath before two justices of the peace that said Petitioners were her slaves and that the Defendant and Witness were about stealing or kidnapping or taking them away (Witness does not recollect which) and they were arrested and thrown into Prison and released by Chief Judge Cranch of this Court and said Petitioners ordered to be delivered to Defendant as his property, which was done; that said Rachael then offered to Defendant that if he would leave said Petitioners with her to wait on her as her support, that she would agree to take them in place of $120 per year alimony allowed her by Prince Geo. County Court, during the time to be paid during the pendency of a suit she had brought for alimony; that Defendant said he would agree to it, provided she would not harass him any more and would give up the $120 per year, otherwise he wanted said Petitioners to sell to pay the fine, it being his object in coming to the City to get them for that purpose, that said Rachael so to agreed and appointed the next day to meet for the purpose of carrying said agreement into effect and promised to have her lawyer Mr Key there; that witness and Defendant remained and went to the place fixed on and neither said Rachael or Mr Key attended. That the Defendant let said Petitioner go with said Rachael upon the evening, she made said proposition to him, thinking she would faithfully carry it into effect, which she did not, but instead of doing it, hid and concealed said Petitioners so that the Defendant could not find them, but was obliged to return home without them, and she kept them so concealed from that time until she came down to Defendants House when she died; she then brought them with her, but the woman Sarah Ann went off before her mistress died and was never heard of again until retaken by Witness. That after the death of said Rachael, the Witness as agent of Defendant heard Petitioners were in Washington City; that he came here to look for them and after some time and some search he found out where they were; that they are hid and concealed in a House of Saml.

That the said Rachael exacted the payment of the amount allowed her by the Court from the Defendant notwithstanding she agreed not to do it, and the said Petitioners were left with her, on that condition alone. That Witness paid $20 himself to her on that account, after that time and that he knows Defendant had two of his negroes, the only two he had sold, for that purpose and to pay her But does not of his own knowledge know that she recd the proceeds of said negroes sale, but believes she did. That he knows said Rachael claimed said alimony allowed her by the Court to the day of her death and that the Defendant was always much pushed to it. That he he also knows that said Defendant often said sent said Rachael, meat, meal &amp;c and gave her other things besides, towards her support. The Petitioners then put interrogatories to the witness, to which he answered 1st that he had no interest directly or indirectly in this cause; that he has had much trouble as the agent of Defendant, and thinks he ought to pay him for his services, but has made no contract with him or demand and shall leave it to himself. 2ndly that at the time said Rachael left her Husband, she the woman did not lived in his House or on his farm and did not for three years after. 3rd That he does not know any thing of the woman alluded to, that he always understood she was of good character until this report got out and that since then she is regarded as of ill from that circumstance. 4th That he never heard or understood from Mrs Wallingsford that she replied to return to her Husband on account of that woman until towards the latter part of her life, when she told him so. The said Witness being again examined by Defendant, said that when Mr Ashton took sd negroes for Defendant they were put into jail by a Justice of the Peace, because they claimed their freedom and that Witness as agent for Defendant obtained from Judge Cranch a Habeas Corpus and that he decided they are not entitled to their freedom under said Deed from said Rachael, she being a feme coverte at the time and was about ordering them to be discharged and delivered to Defendant as his slaves, when the present suit was brought and denied sd Defendant whilst the Judge was deliberating and he refused to order Petitioners to be delivered to Defendant, unless he gave security for their appearance, which not being able to do, they . The defendant then also proved by Henry Ash Leonard Ashton a constable, that he arrested the Petitioners as stated by James Meade, and that he found them in a room up the stairs in a House of Mr Brereton, where they are concealed; that he asked permission of a negro woman who was there to open the door, which was refused and he entered the House from the top of a shed, through a window and found the Petitioners concealed there and took them before a justice of the Peace who committed them to jail.

She often went to her Husband to get money and other things and she has known him to give her money and sometimes give her meat and other things. That there was no complaint made by Mrs Wallingsford about any woman when she left her husband and it was nearly three years before the woman named came to live on Defendants Land, that she then be said she was jealous of that woman, but does not know that she had any cause.
