That is to say First and principally I commit my soul into the hands of Almighty God, My body to the Earth to be decently buried at the discretion of my executor hereafter named, and after my Just debts &amp; funeral charges are paid I give devise and bequeath as follows. It is my will &amp; desire and I hereby order &amp; direct, that all my negro men who shall be of the age of Twenty one years or upwards &amp; all my negro women who shall be of the age of seventeen years or upwards at the time of my decease shall have their freedom immediately thereafter &amp; I hereby enjoin upon &amp; request of my executor hereinafter named, that he will pay particular attention to their obtaining certificates of their freedom. And I further will, order and direct, that my negro Boys who shall be under the age of Twenty one years, &amp; my negro Girls who shall be under the age of seventeen years at the time of my decease except such as I shall hereinafter otherwise dispose of, shall remain on my plantations under the management &amp; control of my Executor until they shall respectively attain the aforesaid ages and then it is my will &amp; desire &amp; I hereby direct that they shall have their freedom. And I further will and direct that such of my negro slaves who from the infirmities incident to old age, or from other causes, shall not be able to support themselves, at the time of my death shall have the right &amp; privilege of remaining on any of my plantations so long as they shall live, &amp; I hereby order and direct that my executor shall provide for them comfortable support and maintainance, the expenses of which I I hereby charge upon my whole estate. Item I give &amp; devise unto the two daughters of my particular friend George Tyler their heirs and assigns forever, so much of the tract or parcel of land which I purchased of William B. Tyler called Brough as is comprehended within the following description and bounds, which I myself have erected in order to designate that portion of said land, which I hereby devise to the two daughters of the said George Tyler: That is to say beginning for the said part, at a Stone planted by me near a Willow Tree standing near the line of Fence, which divides the land which I bought of the said William B. Tyler, from the lands of William B. Mullikin and running thence, easterly to a stone planted by me directly at a line of fence which divided the said land from the lands of William E. Peach, then, by and with said last mentioned line of fence till it intersects the lines of the lands lately owned by Tobias Tyler, then by and with a line of the said Tobias Tyler's land, to a stone planted in the place where the third boundary of the whole tract of land, called Brough, formerly stood, then by &amp; with the courses of the said tract of land called Brough to the aforesaid stone, near the Willow Tree aforesaid, which stone is the beginning of that part of the said land which I purchased of William. B. Tyler, which I hereby devise to the two daughters of the said George Tyler. Item I give &amp; devise unto Mary Anne Magruder, a yellow Girl some years since manumitted by me, the residue of the land which I purchased of the said William. B.
