      <field name="text"> 1 That if the Jury believe from the evidence aforesaid, that the woman Matilda only claimed her freedom by virtue of the letter from Plaintiffs intestate dated in 1827, then no presumption of a deed of manumission cannot be founded on such letter although followed up by her going at large for from the year 1827 to intestates death unless the said intestate was made aware of the fact of her going at large as free during said time Decr. 17. 1841 refusd. by the Court (W.C. doubting) (4) Atkins vs Bowling &amp; Gardner 2nd (A) Even, If the Jury believe from the evidence aforesaid, that the woman Matilda passed as free from the year 1827 to the death of said R.

B. Gardiner dated in 1827, whereas which he showed where as the said Sims had not in fact so manumitted her &amp; that the Plaintiffs brought this suit shortly within a few months after discovering that she had not been so manumitted then no presumption can be founded on such acquiescence, as against the Plaintiffs. refused 17. Decr. 1841 (3) 4th That it is competent for the Jury to find from all the circumstances in the case that no deed of manumission was at any time executed by said Sims or said Gardner, &amp; if they find that no such deed was executed then the Jury cannot find the issue joined for the Defendant on the Plea of freedom. refused. 17. Decr. 1841 5th That to presume a deed of manumission of the woman Matilda, the Jury must be satisfied that she acted &amp; passed as free in a manner different from other slaves in Washington City aforesaid then &amp; there held as slaves Refused. 17. Decr. 1841 (5) 6th Should the Jury be satisfied from the Evidence, that in 1827 Richard B. Gardiner wrote the letter of the 20th Febry. directing Edward Simms, to manumit the negro woman Matilda, and that neither that said Simms or the said Richard B. Gardiner, ever did execute any instrument of writing giving to her said Matilda her freedom and that the said Richard B. Gardiner died in the year 1832 before any that no such deed of manumission was executed before his death they may infer therefore, that the power given in said letter, was had been revoked by the said Richard B.

Refused 17. Decr. 1841 (7) 8th That if the Jury find that the Defendant executed the deed of manumission stated in the evidence then it is competent for the Jury for the Jury to find from the whole evidence that the Defendant has always kept boy George named in the declaration did not pass as free but is now held in servitude by the Defendant as a slave until 21 years of age.

W. C. doubting (9) 10th That no presumption of a deed of manumission made by the administrator plaintiffs, can be made in as much as no law authorises administrators to manumit slaves &amp; no la there is no presumption that the plaintiffs as administrators have done an illegal or unauthorised act or committed a devastavit Refused 17. Decr. 1841 (10) 11 admitted (a) (B) That the Jury are not found from the evidence aforesaid to presume a deed of manumission as claimed by the Defendant by the said Gardiner or the plaintiffs or the said Sims of the woman named Matilda.

And that during that period she bore the children named in the declaration, which children were nurtured &amp; raised by her &amp; her husband, &amp; at their expense. And that the fact of her so going at large as free, &amp; bearing &amp; maintaining her said children was known to said Sims &amp; the said Gardiner.
