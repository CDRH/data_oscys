No. 85. Richard B. Alexander, Plaintiff in Error, vs. Moses Graham, Defendant in Error. Index. Original. Print. Petition to the honorable Roger B.

D. Langtree, Print. To the Honorable Chief Justice Taney. The petition of Richard B. Alexander humbly represents that at March term 1840 of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, for the county of Washington, on a petition for freedom filed by Moses Graham against the said Richard B. Alexander, complaining of illegal detention in slavery, judgment was rendered for the said Richard B. Alexander, but not as full and complete a judgment as ought in law have been rendered in the case, as will more fully appear by a copy of the record and proceedings in the said cause and hereto annexed. And the said Richard B. Alexander assigns error as follows: The first fact the jury find in the special verdict (bearing on the point in error) is, "that Miss Brown sold Milly and her two children to Mrs. Alexander, she to be free at 31, and her children then, born and then afterwards to be born, at the same age." They further find that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be that they were to be free at 31 years of age." Upon a reference, however, to the will of Miss Brown (in the transcript of the proceedings) it will be found that the petitioner (Moses Graham) is not mentioned or referred to; is not emancipated by any possibility of construction which the court could, by law, give to the instrument. Now the error assigned by the defendant is in the erroneous application of the law to the above facts. The law of Virginia 1792 Chap. 103, Section 36 (and applicable to this case) provides that slaves shall be emancipated either by last will and testament or by deed recorded in the county or corporation court. Any other method of emancipation is void. As such is the law, the fact found by the jury, that "Milly" (mother of the petitioner) "and her children, were sold to Mrs. Alexander, to be free as they should respectively arrive at the age of 31 years" does not amount to such an emancipation as the law requires. The fact found by the jury that "Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of such negroes to be, that they were to be free at 31 years of age" is an encroachment on the province of the court, whose duty it is to decide as to the import and construction of last wills and testaments. it will be found upon a reference to this will, that the petitioner (Moses) is not mentioned in such will, is not referred to by the testatrix, that there is not the remotest implication by which his freedom can be effected. Notwithstanding the said will does not emancipation the petitioner, and although the law peremptorily requires the emancipation to be by deed or last will and testament, the court gives to the petitioner his freedom at the age of 31 years. The error above assigned involves a question of law, of extensive interest, both public and private—of a public interest, since it admits the reception of parol evidence to explain and enlarge the meaning of a will, to give to a last will and testament a different meaning from that which the words in themselves evidently and necessarily imply—of a private interest to the defendant, since there are several other slaves having similar claims, in whose favour similar verdicts would be found, and which verdicts would be construed by the court, as having a similar legal effect and operation, unless the Supreme Court shall reverse so erroneous a decision. Wherefore, your petitioner prays that your honor will issue an order to the clerk of the said court, directing him to issue a writ of error under the terms and conditions prescribed by law in all such cases, and as in duty bound he will ever pray. Swann &amp; Swann, Attorneys. On the back of the aforegoing petition was the following order to wit: I have read and considered the within petition of Richard B. Alexander, the defendant in the within mentioned case, and also the proceedings of the circuit court therein referred to, and complained of by the petitioner, a copy of which proceedings accompanies this petition, and being of opinion that the errors assigned and relied on, involve questions of law of such extensive interest and operation, as to render the final decision of them by the Supreme Court desirable, I do hereby direct the clerk of Washington county to issue the writ of error as prayed for, upon the terms and conditions in such cases prescribed by law. R. B. Taney. Whereupon, in pursuance of the above order a writ of error issued, and a citation, directed to the said Moses Graham as follows, to wit: The United States of America, ss. The President of the United States, to the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, sitting for the County of Washington, greeting: Because in the record and proceedings, as also in the rendition of the judgment of a plea, which is in the said court before you or same of you, between Moses Graham, plaintiff, and Richard B. Alexander, defendant, a manifest error hath happened, to the great damage of the said Richard B. Alexander, as by his complaint appears. We being willing, that error, if any hath been, should be duly corrected, and full and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid in this behalf, do command you if judgment be therein given, that under your seal, distinctly and openly, you send the record and proceedings aforesaid, with all things concerning the same, to the Supreme Court of the United States, together with this writ, so that you have the same at Washington in said Supreme Court now sitting, and that the record and proceedings aforesaid being inspected, the said Supreme Court may cause further to be done therein to that error, which of right, and according the laws and custom of the United States should be done. Witness the Hon. Roger B. Taney, chief justice of the said Supreme Court. Issued this 3d day of February, 1841. W. Brent, Clerk, Circuit Court D. C. for Washington County. District of Columbia, to wit: The United States of America to Moses Graham, greeting: You are hereby cited and admonished to be and appear at a Supreme Court of the United States immediately, pursuant to a writ of error filed in teh clerk's office of the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, sitting for the county of Washington, wherein Richard B. Alexander is plaintiff in error, and you are defendant in error, to shew cause if any there be, why judgment rendered against you should not be corrected, and why speedy justice should not be done to the parties in this behalf.

Key, Esq., attorney for Moses Graham. Washington City, District Columbia, January the ninth, 1841. Alexander Hunter, Marshal, District of Columbia. Know all men by there presents that we, Richard B. Alexander and William B. Alexander, are held and firmly bound unto the United States, in the full and just sum of twenty-four hundred dollars, current money of the United States, to be paid to the said United States or their certain attorney, or assigns, to which payment well and truly to be made and done, we bind ourselves and each of us, our, and each of our heirs, executors and administrators jointly and severally, firmly by these presents, sealed with our seals and dated this third day of February 1841. Whereas, lately at a circuit court of the District of Columbia, sitting for the county of Washington, in a cause depending in the said circuit court, wherein a certain Moses Graham was plaintiff, and the said Richard B. Alexander was defendant, judgment was rendered in favour of the said defendant, and he having obtained a writ of error, and filed a copy thereof in the clerk's office of the said circuit court, to reverse the judgment in the aforesaid suit, and a citation directed to the said Moses Graham, citing and admonishing him to be and appear at a Supreme Court of the United States immediately. Now the condition of the above obligation is such, that if the said Richard B. Alexander shall prosecute his writ to effect and answer all damages and costs of he fails to make his plea good, then the above obligation to be null and void, otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue in law. R. B. Alexander. [L.S.] W. B. Alexander. [L.S.] Signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of Wm. Tho. Swann. Edw. Swann. Style of Court. District of Columbia, ss.

We find, that the petitioner is the son of Milly who was the slave of Miss Brown, who resided in Georgetown about the year 1790 and for two or three years afterwards, with her sister Mrs. Magruder, that she afterwards lived with the same sister in Maryland, and, and afterwards, but not before 1806, with her sister Mrs. Alexander in Alexandria county; that during all this time the petitioner's mother and grandmother belonged to Miss Brown, who sometime about the year 1813, while she was living with Mrs. Alexander, brought Milly from Washington county where she had been living, hired out by her mistress for one or two years, to Mrs. Alexander, in Alexandria county. That Milly then had two female children, and that the petitioner was born afterwards, and while Milly was at Mrs. Alexander's. That Mr. Brown on bringing her to Mrs. Alexander's sold Milly and her two children to Mrs. Alexander, she to be free at 31, and her children then born, and those afterward to be born, at the same age. That the petitioner was held by Mrs. Alexander during her life, and by her administrator the present defendant since, not as a slaver for life, but as entitled to freedom at 41 years of age. That Miss Brown died in 1825 making her last will and testament (copied in page 20). That Miss Brown by her will recognized the terms of sale of said negroes to her sister to be, that they were to be free at 31 years of age. And that the petitioner will be on the 25th of December, 1839, twenty-six of age. That Miss Brown sent an officer for Milly to Georgetown, where she was then residing, and from whence she was brought in 1813 to her sister with the intention to sell her and her children to her sister, and did thereupon sell her as before stated on the terms and conditions stated in her will. And that said Milly was kept in Alexandria county from the time of her said importation till she became 31 years of age, when she was suffered to go free and is free now.
