Purnell Pendleton to the Additional Cross Interrogatories on the part of the Petitioner. To the first additional Cross Interrogatory this deponent answereth and saith, that in a former answer he stated that his Aunt Miss Purnell opposed his taking the petitioner to Virginia with him (the deponent) and was aware that he (the deponent) was taking the petition from Maryland, and used no other means than earnest persuasion, as no other means were in her power at the time. To the 2d Cross Interrogatory. This deponent answereth and saith that Miss Purnell had full knowledge of the fact that the Petitioner was with the deponent in Virginia, and used no coercive means to have him returned to Maryland, but from time to time earnestly urged this deponent to send the Petitioner back to Maryland. To 3d Cross Interrogatory. This deponent answereth and saith, that Miss Purnell was in Virginia, and knew this deponent had the Petitioner in his possession. And that she took no other means to recover the Petitioner than earnestly to urge this deponent that the Petitioner should not remain in his (the Petitioner) present situation. To 4th Cross Interrogatory. This deponent answereth and saith that he believes this Interrogatory has been fully answered in a fourth former Interrogatory, he will however state that Miss Purnell was in Virginia when the Petitioner was there, and was aware of the deponent permitting the Petitioner to come to the District of Columbia, which permission given to the Petitioner by this deponent was expressly contrary to the will and desire of Miss Purnell. Answer of I. Purnell Pendleton to Cross Interrogatory in behalf of defendant To this Interrogatory.
