Love and Car Withers &amp; Thomas Langston are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the full and just sum of Twelve hundred Dollars lawful money of the United States to the payment of which we bind ourselves and each of us, our and each of our heirs, executors and administrators jointly &amp; severally firmly by these presents. Sealed with our Seals and dated this twenty second day of August Eighteen hundred and sixteen</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Condition of the above Obligation is such that whereas at the Term of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia held for the County of Alexandria the 24th day of April 1816, it was ordered amongst other things that "Jane alias Jane Williams" (who was allowed by the Court to sue in forma pauperis for her freedom) "be taken into the Custody of the Marshal until her owner shall give Bond &amp; Security in the sum of Twelve hundred Dollars with Condition to have her forthcoming to answer the Judgment of the Court". Now if the said Richard H. Love shall well and truly comply with the said order, and have the said Jane alias Jane Williams forthcoming to answer the Judgment of the Court, then the above obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue in Law.</p>
