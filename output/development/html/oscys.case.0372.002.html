<p class="tei_p">Alexandria Decr. 15th 1807</p>

<p class="tei_p">Fanny Smith, who has petitioned the Honble Judges of the Circuit Court for permission to sue before them in forma pauperis for freedom appears from the evidence which has been produced to me to have been born in the County of St. Mary's in Maryland, and to have been brought to this place by a citizen of <del>Maryland</del> that state since the operation of the law prohibiting the importation of slaves; but it does not appear that the person who imported her, or the circumstances under which she was imported come within any of the exceptions for that law. I think therefore thatthe prayer of the petitioner ought to be granted. All which is most respectfully submitted.</p>
