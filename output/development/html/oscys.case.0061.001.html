<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">The petition of George Hunter, a person of color, humbly sheweth to your Honors that your petitioner was introduced into the State of Maryland from the State of Virginia several years since by a certain William M. Offutt, then being a citizen of the State of Maryland: and that by the noncompliance of the said Offutt with the requisitions of the Act of Assembly of Maryland in which <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">case[?]</span> made and provided, your petitioner has become intitled to his freedom. And your petitioner humbly sheweth that he is credibly informed &amp; verily believes that the said Offutt conspiring with one Zadock Offutt (who likewise claims some interest in your petitioner) to defraud him of his rights, designs to transfer him to some far distant state, where, cut off from all means of establishing his <del>right</del> freedom, he will be doomed to a hopeless slavery for life. <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">To[?]</span> avert which cruel fate, your petitioner humbly prays the judgment of this Honorable Court that he be released from <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">further[?]</span> <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span>.</p>
