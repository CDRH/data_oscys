<p class="tei_p">Slaves cannot be manumitted in Washington County, D.C., by last will, if over forty-five years old at the time the manumission is to take effect.</p>

<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">Petition for freedom. The petitioners claimed freedom
under the will of John Baptist Kirby, by which they were to
be free at his death. Some of them were over forty-five years of age at the
death of the testator.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Ashton, for the defendant,
prayed the Court to instruct the jury that if any of the petitioners were over
the age of forty-five at the testator's death, the manumission was void as to
them; and cited <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Burrough v. Negro
Anna, 4 Harr. &amp; Johns.</span> and <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Hamilton v. Cragg, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 16</span>.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Coxe, contà. There were formerly, in
Maryland, different opinions in regard to this question,
but the Court of Appeals of Maryland have decided it
since the formation of this district. While the law was unsettled in
Maryland, this Court decided that the manumission was
valid if provision was made by the testator against the slaves being a burden
upon the public.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Previous to the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">Act of 1752, c. 1</span>, manumission by will was lawful; otherwise
that act would have been unnecessary, (see its preamble,) and the second
section does not make void the manumission, but only subjects the party to a
penalty, and obliges him to support the negro during his life, "whereby he
may not become a burden to others, or perish through want, to the great
scandal of christian society." The object of the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">thirteenth section of the
Act of 1796, c. 67</span>, is the same as that of the second section of the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">Act of
1752</span>, which is repealed by the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">twelfth section of the Act of 1796</span>. The
interpretation should be in favor of liberty. "And," in the thirteenth
section, should be constructed to be "or," so as to read thus, "unless the

slave or slaves shall be under the age of forty-five years," or able to work and
gain a sufficient maintenance and livelihood." This testator has made sufficient
provision for the maintenance of the old and infirm, as well as of the young.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Ashton, in reply. The
legislature of 1796 intended to fix the rule of age as the qualification for
manumission, in order to avoid disputes as to the ability of the slave to
maintain himself, if over that age. It is a clear and definite line drawn; and
although under forty-five, the negro must still be able to maintain himself.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court stopped Mr. Ashton, and said that the law of 1796
was positive and clear, and that the decisions of the Court of Appeals of
Maryland upon their own law are to be respected by this
Court.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court (nem. con.) gave the
instruction as prayed by Mr. Ashton.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Verdict and judgment accordingly.</p>
