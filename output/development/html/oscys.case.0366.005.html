<p class="tei_p">This morning I came to Alexandria in order to lay in a Small Assortment of goods for a retail store, and have employed boats &amp; hands to take the same to Piscataway which will cost me 10$ per day. when I landed I was summoned as a witness on a case wherein a Negroe woman Luce sues for her freedom. This woman I believe was the property of Colo. Wm Lyles &amp; married a black man by the name of Jack Neale (it was currently reported in the neighbourhood of Piscataway that the sd. Jack Neale was permitted by the Colo. Lyles to work in Piscataway as a blacksmith for the space of about 4 years for the Liberation of the sd. Neal &amp; his wife); but as to me being a witness, that Jack Neal &amp; his wife lived (who were both the property of Colo. Lyles about the year 1798, are now free or slaves I know not. N. B. Jack Neal persuaded me to keep his blacksmiths <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">a/cs[?]</span> which I did, &amp; they were kept in his name. If it will please your honours to permit to go about my business this Evening; it will greatly oblige</p>
