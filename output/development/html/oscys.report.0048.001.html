<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">The Court (Thruston, J., absent,) at the prayer of the defendant's counsel, instructed the jury that the plaintiff did not acquire a right to freedom by being brought into Alexandria, and continuing there one year, unless he was continued there a year by one and the same master. For the loss of the property in the slaves was in the nature of a penalty; that no freedom can be acquired under the second section of the act, but in a case in which the penalty of $200 also is incurred, under the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">third section of the act of 17th of December, 1792</span>.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Taylor, for the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Stone, for the defendant.</p>
