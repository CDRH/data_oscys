<p class="tei_p">Answers &amp; depositions of Mrs Mary M Thorndike to the annexed interrogatories &amp; cross interrogatories </p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 1st Interrogatory she answers I am acquainted with the parties &amp; have known them for so long as I can remember anything. the defendant is my sister.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 2d Interrogatory she answers, the Petitioner is a slave and always has been. he was the property of defendant's &amp; my father, who died about the year 1810 or 1811 and under his will was assigned to the defendant who has since owned said slave. Said slave was <del>born and</del> raised in Caroline County of the State of Maryland and as I have always understood was there born. I have heard from others of his having left the state and county of late years, but having during this period been a resident of Boston I have no personal knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 3d Interrogatory she answers, I have no personal knowledge on the subject of this interrogatory.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 4th Interrogatory she answers, It may be material to say that on my return, on a visit to Caroline County, on being informed that the petitioner had gone to Virginia, I remonstrated with the defendant for having suffered it and ascertained that his going thither and continuance there were greatly against her will and beyond her control.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 1st Cross interrogatory she answers. Miss Purnell has two sisters and several nephews &amp; nieces of deceased brothers &amp; sisters who it is supposed would inherit her property in the event of her death without a will. &amp; I have the strongest reason to believe that she has made no will.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 3d Cross Interrogatory she answers, I have no knowledge except from the report of others on the subject of this Interrogatory, nor have I any

reason to suppose that the Petitioner was given to I. Purnell Pendleton, but all my information is to the contrary.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 4th Cross Interrogatory she answers, His time, as far as I know or have understood, has been divided between <del>the Eastern Shore of</del> Maryland &amp; the State of Virginia.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 5th Cross Interrogatory she answers, I have never heard such a declaration from either of them.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 6th Cross Interrogatory she answers, I have know knowledge of any such representations or dealings on the part of I. Purnell Pendleton.</p>
