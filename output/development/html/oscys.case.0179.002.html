We being willing that error, if any hath been, should be duly corrected and full and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid in this behalf, do command you if judgment be therein given, that under your seal distinctly and openly you send the record and proceedings aforesaid, with all things concerning the same to the Supreme Court of the United States, together with this writ, so that you have the same at Washington, in said Supreme Court to be there held in the second Monday in January next. So that the record and proceedings aforesaid being inspected, the said Supreme Court may cause further to be done therein to correct that error, which of right and according to the law &amp; custom of the United States should be done.</p>
