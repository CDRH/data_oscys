<p class="tei_p">That the said Mary Hurdle was an old Woman at that time and has been dead about thirty years; that the deponant has always understood that the said Mary Hurdle was one hundred and two years of age when she died. That some of the company asked her who Anne Joyce was

and she said she came into this Country a young woman with Lord Baltimore. That the said Mary Hurdle then lived near Nottingham and this deponent and her husband lived with her. That she always lived in Prince Georges County as the deponent understood from her; that she came into this Country when about thirteen years old &amp; served her time for her passage four years in the neighbourhood of Upper Marlborough as she had heard her say; &amp; she has understood from Mary Hurdle that she came into this Country about the time that Lord Baltimore came in; That she recollects <span class="tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_or tei_gap_extent_three tei_gap_extent_words tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> that she heard Mary Hurdle say that <span class="tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_words tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> if Lord Baltimore had staid here, it would not have <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_or tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_words tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> been so; That she has also heard the Tuckers &amp; Lovejoys who were old people and who are now dead talk about it, but can't recollect what they said, more than they censured those who kept them.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That she heard her mother in law speak of Mr Darnall and Mr Carroll as great folks but she does not remember that she ever heard her mother in Law say that Joice lived with Mr Darnall or Mr Carroll or with whom she lived</p>

<span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_paragraph tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span>

<p class="tei_p">Did you ever mention the circumstances that you have above <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">submited[?]</span> to any person and to whom and when.</p>

<p class="tei_p">She never did. She said she <del>never</del> knew nothing but what she heard from her mother in law</p>

<p class="tei_p">She further saith that she heard her mother in law say <del>that</del> that Joice was a <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">clever[?]</span> pretty woman and that she was of an East India family <del>the meaning of which she does not know</del> That she understood that she came of a family that lived in the East Indias but she <del>do</del> never saw one that came from there and does not know whether they are white or black nor did she ever hear her mother in law say

whether Joice was white or black.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Had you never any conversation with your daughter Priscilla who lives in the Federal City about the claim of the Petitioners or the descendants of Joice, to freedom, if you <del>did</del> had at what time was it, and what did you inform her.</p>

<p class="tei_p">She says she never <del>understood</del> had any conversation with her daughter on the subject to the best of her recollection and never told her any thing about it unless her daughter overheard her lately when she was talking with the Petitioner Charles Mahoney. She does not recollect to have mentioned it to any person except lately to Mr Robert Brent who asked her if she had not given her deposition she said no and that she knew nothing that would do good or harm to any person, nothing but what she heard from her mother in Law; Mr Brent desired her to tell him what she knew or had heard and she did accordingly relate to him what she had heard <del>in the same manner that the same is stated in this deposition</del> in substance the same that she has stated in this her deposition except what she has declared upon the cross examination of John T. Mason which is all stated in his hand writing and except what she has stated to have heard from the Lovejoys &amp; the Tuckers.</p>

<p class="tei_p">That her daughter may have casually heard her speak of the subject but she never did directly and purposely converse with her said daughter about it.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the best of her memory she never had any conversation with her daughter on the subject.</p>

<p class="tei_p">This deponent did not consider any thing she had heard her mother say could operate one way or the other.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Tuckers she speaks of was Thomas Tucker &amp; Mary his wife who lived on Patuxent about ten miles from Nottingham which was the nearest town they had to go and they have both been dead upwards of forty years and near fifty years.</p>
