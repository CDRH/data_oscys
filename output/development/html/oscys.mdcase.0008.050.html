<p class="tei_p">In the Court of Appeals</p>

<p class="tei_p">June Term 1802</p>

<p class="tei_p">Reverend John Ashton<br/>
against<br/>
Charles Mahoney</p>

<p class="tei_p">Five Exceptions stated in the Records</p>

</div>

<div class="body">

<p class="tei_p">3rd Exception. The Court disagree with the General Court in their opinion in this Exception. The Court are of opinion that the General Court ought not to have permitted the Special Verdict found on the first Trial which was set aside, (because a fact was not sufficiently found) to be read in Evidence on the second Trial. They consider it a good rule, that on a second Trial, no advantage or use shall be made by either of the parties of the first finding, or of the opinion of the Court in setting aside the Verdict, but that such second Trial shall as far as possible be conducted as if no prior trial had been had.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Record before the Court proves the propriety of the Rule. On the first Trial an objection was made by the Defendant below to a Deposition offered by the Plaintiff, the General Court over ruled the objection The Deposition was read and Defendants Counsel then took an Exception to their Opinion; By granting

a new trial and admitting the Verdict in Evidence the Defendant there is deprived of the benefit of his Exception, and he is liable to be affected by the Verdict that may possibly in some measure have been influenced by the Evidence excepted to.</p>

<p class="tei_p">4th Exception. As to this Exception the Court are of opinion that the General Court were right in their direction to the Jury. It is merely stated that Ann Joice was in England and came from thence, without showing her Condition previous to the Period alluded to, whereby it doth not appear that she was ever held or claimed as a slave at any time, and it might be that she was a White Woman or Native of England; presumption when admitted being in favour of freedom. In deciding this Exception the Court do not think themselves at liberty to travel out of the Exception, or notice any fact not therein stated.</p>

<p class="tei_p">5th Exception. Upon the fifth <del>and last Exception</del> Exception this Court disagree with the General Court. It is in that Exception stated, that Ann Joice a negroe woman was

carried with her owner Lord Baltimore claiming her as a Slave, from the Island of Barbadoes to England, and afterwards brought into this Country by him claiming her as a Slave between the years 1678 and 1681. And that she during her life was held and treated as a slave, and that her Issue have been held as slaves ever since. It is not stated that her Case was ever before a British or any other Tribunal, or had received a judicial decision.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Great industry hath been used and great ability displayed by the Counsel in the argument of this Cause. The Decision involving on the one hand the question of Freedom or Slavery to the Plaintiff before, and on the other great pecuniary interests to persons claiming Negroes under similar Circumstances, demanded it.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court have  felt the importance of the subject and given it their most serious consideration. if this Case was before a british Court it would seem that the Question should be decided according to the british Law

as it stood between the years 1678 and 1681 and not by the Law as it may have been modified or altered subsequent to that period. No adjudged case in the British books hath been cited, nor have the Court been able to find one coming up to the Case in the Exception. Opposing cases as well as opinions of particular Judges and Law writers have been cited as applicable to the Case. About the period of Ann Joices being in England, a diversity of opinions of opinions prevailed on that Subject. At one period it was held by a Judge that a Slave by being brought to England thereby became free some times it hath been held that Trover would lie, at other times that it would not, that the sale of a negroe was a sufficient consideration to support assumpsit to pay the price, that a master deprived of his Slave might support an Action per <span class="tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_or tei_gap_extent_three tei_gap_extent_words tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span>. By British charters and British Acts of Parliament the slave trade hath been authorised and encouraged, and Slaves have been considered there as Merchandize, as Chattels, as

propety, and have by a British Statute operating in this State been subjected  to be sold and disposed of as other property for the payment of debts. Lord Chief Justice Talbot and Sir Philip York in 1729 expressly declare that a Slave coming from the West Indies with or without his Master to Great Britain or Ireland, doth not become free and that his Master's property or right in him is not thereby determined or varied &amp;c. And that his Master may legally compel him to return. This opinion is recognised by Hardwick acting as Chancellor in 1749, and that Trover would be for a Negroe. Judge Blackstone in his Commentaries in 1765 II Edition Page 127 says that a Slave or Negroe the moment he lands in England falls under the protection of the Laws and so far becomes a freeman though the Masters right to his service may probably still continue. And in page 424 same Edition repeats the same and adds that the Law will protect him in the enjoyment of his person and property. But yet with regard to any right

which the Master may have lawfully acquired to the perpetual service of John or Thomas, this will remain exactly in the same state as before, for this is no more than the same subjection for life, which every Apprentice submits to for the space of seven years or more &amp;c. In the British books slaves are some times called Slaves or Servants, and it is said by Lord Mansfield in Somersets Case that there may be a <em class="tei_term">Villein in Gross</em> by confession. In the Case of Somerset in 1772, Lord Mansfield mentioned the opinions of Sir Philip York and Lord Chief Justice Talbot in 1729, and recognized by Lord Hardwicke in 1749 and calls them two of the greatest men of their own or any times, and says he pays all due attention to their Opinions. Lord Mansfield puts several questions as to the Law with respect to their Settlements, their wages, actions for any slight coercion by their masters. In Somerset's cause the Court declined deciding the question, whether by being carried to England he thereby became free, but say that they would

judge upon the return of the Habeas Corpus and according to their own Laws; which did not admit of so high an Act of dominion as in that Case had been exercised by the Master over his Slave, and therefore that Somerset must be discharges. Lord Mansfield in Somerset's Case says that the sate of Slavery is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive Law. In this Collision of individual opinions and opposing decisions in the British books this Court will not say what would have been the decision of a British Tribunal on the Question stated in the Exception, and acting as a Court of an Independent Country, unfettered by any Political Stipulations on subjects of this nature, and bound to decide according to the Laws of this State, they do not consider themselves at liberty to adopt <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_or tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_words tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> all opinion that might possibly prevail in a foreign Tribunal. By a positive Law of this State in 1715, then ye Province of Maryland, the relation of Master and Slave is recognized as then existing, and all Negroe and other Slaves then imported or thereafter to be imported into this

Province, and all Children then born or thereafter to be born of such Negroes or Slaves are declared to be Slaves during their Natural lives.</p>

<p class="tei_p">This Case, being brought before the Court by original proceeding we are of Opinion that it must be governed by the Law of this State, and that in this Case, however the Laws of Great Britain <del>might</del> in such <del>Instances when the persons were there</del> Instances <del>upon su</del> operating upon such persons <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> might interpose <del>so as</del> so as to prevent the exercise of certain Acts by the Master not permitted <del>there</del>, as in the case of Somerset, yet upon the bringing Ann Joice into this State then the Province of Maryland, the relation of Master and Slave continued in its extent as authorized by the Laws of this State, and therefore that the Judgment of the General Court must be reversed As to the other Exceptions this Court concur with the General Court</p>
