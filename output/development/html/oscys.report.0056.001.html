<p class="tei_p">The plaintiff was born in 1811, before the expiration of the seven years, and the bill of sale and obligation to emancipate Clara, was not recorded until after the plaintiff's birth. Finley emancipated Clara in 1817, but always claimed the plaintiff as his slave, she having been born while her mother was his slave.</p>

<p class="tei_p">On the 3d of June, 1833, Stewart made a deed of emancipation of the plaintiff, (Ann.)</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Taylor, for the defendant. The plaintiff was born the slave of Mr. Finley. Her mother, at the time of the plaintiff's birth, was also his slave. She had then no present vested right to freedom; it depended upon Mr. Finley's complying with his covenant with Mr. Stewart. The plaintiff was the slave of Finley, and not the slave of Stewart, and his deed of emancipation was void. <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Thrift v.

<p class="tei_p">The Court (Thruston, J., absent,) was of opinion that the law was for the defendant, and that the plaintiff is a slave.</p>
