<p class="tei_p">Answers. To the first question</p>

<p class="tei_p">If the Widow stands to the will I apprehend she cannot interfere with the Provision made in favor of the negroes or prevent its taking effect.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the Second</p>

<p class="tei_p">I think as to the negroes who will be entitled to freedom under the will there ought to be a double appraisment one Column stating the value of them as servants for the time they are to remain slaves. the other column stating their value as they ought to be appraised provided there had been no provisions in the will for their future freedom for as <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">to[?]</span> <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">creditors[?]</span> the Executor would be answerable to their full value as a Testator cannot manumit slaves to their <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span></p>

<p class="tei_p">All such slaves as are upwards of forty five years of age or shall become upwards of forty five years of age before their time of labour would expire are to be appraised as slaves. the will not operating in their favor.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the third</p>

<p class="tei_p">Such negroes cannot be free.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 4th</p>

<p class="tei_p">Such increase will not be entitled to their freedom</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the 5th</p>

<p class="tei_p">The <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">devise[?]</span> to Mrs Abeal is a lapsed legacy in consequence of her Death in the life time of the Testator and goes as a part &amp; the residuum to the residuary Legalee.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The sixth Question</p>

<p class="tei_p">is answered by the answer to the first—</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.case.0036.012.002.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%252Foscys.case.0036.012.002.jpg/full/!1500,1500/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/iiif/2/oscys%2Foscys.case.0036.012.002.jpg/full/!150,150/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
   
<p class="tei_p">To the 7th</p>

<p class="tei_p">If she quits her claim under the will and resorts to her legal eighth. as far as she takes negroes in part of her third she can only take them to serve her for the pound, directed by the will. and can be only changed with the value to which <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> period of service <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> are apparaised.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the Eighth</p>

<p class="tei_p">As Mr Thompson made a will, she the widow should renounce yet I am opinion she can only be entitled to the third of the personal Estate. the question is however depending before the General Court.</p>

<p class="tei_p">To the Ninth</p>

<p class="tei_p">James Thompson <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">takes[?]</span> in the real Estate <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">deceased[?]</span> whom an Estate for Life with <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> Estate to this first <del>Charles</del> son he may have by his present wife. Should he have no such son, <del>but Daughter</del> he has the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">period[?]</span> of appointing such of his children as he thinks proper to take the same agrreeable to the will</p>

<p class="tei_p">As to the personal Estate Mr Thompson takes the <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> of the personal Estate for his life if he should have a son by his present wife that son would probably be entitled to it after her death. or it will go in the usual course of distribution</p>
