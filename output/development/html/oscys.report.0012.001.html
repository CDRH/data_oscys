<p class="tei_p">Negro Jack Garretson v. Lingan.</p>

</div>

<div class="syllabus">

<p class="tei_p">Length of time does not raise a presumption against a
slave, that his owner took the oath required by law.</p> 

</div>

<div class="body">
 
<p class="tei_p">Petition for freedom. The petitioner was carried,
by his owner, from Maryland to
Virginia, in the year 1784, and kept there several
years, and then brought back to Maryland. By the <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">law
of Virginia of 17th of
December, 1792, p. 186</span>, the slave was entitled to his freedom,
unless the owner took a certain oath within sixty days after his removal to
Virginia.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Key and Mr. Caldwell, for the defendant,
moved the Court to instruct the jury, that after such a lapse of time they
have a right to presume that the oath was duly taken agreeably to law. The
law did not require that there should be any record of the taking of the
oath. It is a fact which may be proved by parol. Judge
White in Virginia has decided in
favor of the presumption.</p>

<p class="tei_p">Mr. Taney and Mr. Jones, contrà, stated that
there is a contrary decision in <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">5 Munford, 542</span>, and that Judge
Dade had decided in the same way. The presumption could
arise only from the acquiescence of the petitioner; but that presumption is
rebutted by the state of slavery in which he has been held, which disabled
him from asserting his rights.</p>

<p class="tei_p">The Court (Cranch, C. J., doubting,) refused
to give the instruction.</p>
