<p class="tei_p">The Petition of Negro Sylvia humbly sheweth that your Petitioner about 8 or 10 years ago was <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">brot[?]</span> by Geo Coryell of Alexa. who now claims the Said Sylvia as a slave into the State of New Jersey, that she remained in the sd state of New Jersey for the space of about 2 years from whence she was removed into this State where she was removed into this State and <del>further this</del> where she has remained ever since, your Petitioner conceiving that under those Circumstances she is Entitled to her Freedom she therefore prays that she may be permitted to institute her Suit in forma pauperis according to the Act of Assembly in Such Cases made &amp; provided &amp; your Petitioner as in duty bound will pray &amp;c</p>

<p class="tei_p">From the Facts stated in the above Petition it appears to me that under the Laws of this State it is doubtful whether <del>and</del> the Petitioner is entitled, but that it is extremely probable that under the Laws of New Jersey which the Courts of this State will recognize <del>she</del> her residing there 2 years will entitle her to freedom, and I am of opinion that there exists no circumstance to induce this Court to deny their interference</p>
