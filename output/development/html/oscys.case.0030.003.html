<p class="tei_p">to the fourth Inter. he saeth that Violet and her children were sent back to Washington by the deft in the summer or fall of 1811— and  that <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">between[?]</span> nothing <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">deny[?]</span> sale of the petitioner not included in this foregoing interrogatories and the answers <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">therto[?]</span>.</p>

After Violet and her children had remained a month or two in this county — this affiants having been requested by the deft by letter to take them in his possession and procured a conveyance for them to Washington— went to Mount Zion. Where they then were and pursuant to to the request of the deft. directed her to return with her children to the  house of this affiant which she promised to do.
