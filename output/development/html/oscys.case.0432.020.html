<p>Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, the Petitioner <del>further</del> and defendant having offered the evidence contained in the first bill of exceptions <del>to maintain her action for freedom, introduced witnesses who testified</del> <span class="tei_gap_extent_unknown tei_gap_reason_torn tei_gap_reason_page tei_gap">[torn page]</span> <del>marked A.]</del> and this being all the <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_reason_strikethrough tei_gap">[strikethrough]</span> evidence adduced, as the part of the Petitioner and defendant aforesaid the defts: by their Counsel, prayed the Court to instruct the Jury, that the testimony aforesaid, altho' believed by the Jury, is not sufficient in Law, to maintain the issue Jd and therefore the Law, is for the defts:</p>

<p>But the Court, <del>not</del> refused to give the instructions so prayed, not being <span class="tei_gap_extent_unknown tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap">[illegible]</span> willing to certify that the Evidence so stated as aforesaid <del>contains</del> is all the evidence adduced by the parties in the said cause, and because such an instruction would take the cause from the consideration of the Jury without giving the Petitioner the benefit of the presumption which the Jury might draw from the facts so given in Evidence.</p>

<p>To which refusal the Dfts except and this their bill of exceptions is signed sealed and ordered to be enrolled, this 18th of May 1842</p>
