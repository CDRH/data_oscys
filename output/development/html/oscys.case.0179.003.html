<p class="tei_p">First.

And whereas the term for which the said Milly was sold has expired, and her said children are bound to serve 'til they shall have attained the age of thirty one years respectively, now it is my will and desire that the time of the said four children of Milly shall be purchased by my Executor and that they shall be forthwith emancipated by him. And I do hereby authorized him to make such purchase out of the Estate I shall leave. But as the amount for which I sold the said Milly and her two children has never been paid to me it is my desire that that debt shall be applied if practicable towards the said purchase.</p>
