<p>Davis v. Forrest.</p>

</div>

<div class="syllabus">

<p>A record of a recovery of freedom by the female ancestor of the petitioner, on the
ground of her having been born free, may be given in evidence to support the petitioner's
title, although the present defendant was not a party to that record; and the depositions of
deceased witnesses, contained in that record, may be read as hearsay, to prove
pedigree.</p>

<p>A party producing a record in evidence is not obliged to read the whole of it; but the
opposite party may read it.</p> 

<p>Particular acts of turpitude cannot be given in evidence to discredit a witness. The question
is only as to his general character for veracity. But see <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl_xml:id_oscys.caseid.0251 tei_bibl">Wood v. Davis, 7 Cranch, 271</span>; <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl_xml:id_oscys.caseid.0028 tei_bibl">Henry

<p>Petition for freedom.</p>

<p>Mr. E. J. Lee, for the petitioner, offered the record of
a recovery in a suit for freedom by <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Rosamond
Bentley v. A. Addison</span>, which the Court (Cranch, C. J., absent,) admitted as evidence, to
prove the freedom of Mary Davis, the ancestor of the present petitioner, and of
the said Rosamond Bentley, who was the petitioner's aunt.</p>

<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/oscys/1500/oscys.report.0005.001.002.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/oscys/1500/oscys.report.0005.001.002.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://cdrhmedia.unl.edu/images/oscys/150/oscys.report.0005.001.002.jpg" class="display &#xA;              "/></a></span>

<p>Mr. Lee, in support of his motion, contended that hearsay
evidence would be admissible, and, if so, à
fortiori a record which, although between other parties, goes to the
same facts. <span class="tei_bibl_type_code tei_bibl">Peake, L. E. 8, 9</span>; <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Taylor v. Cole, cited in
7 T. R. note (a)</span>; and <span class="tei_bibl_type_case tei_bibl">Pegram v. Isabell, 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 193.</span></p>

<p>The Court also suffered the depositions of witnesses,
now dead, which had been taken in that suit and made part of that record, to be
read in evidence as hearsay. The Court also suffered the defendant to read such
parts only of a record which he produced as he thought proper, and said it was
competent for the counsel of the petitioner to read the residue. The Court also
admitted in evidence the record of a recovery by the petitioner's sister,
Susan Davis, of her freedom, on the ground of having been
freeborn.</p>

<p>Verdict for the defendant.</p>
