<p class="tei_p">R. I. Taylor assigned as Counsel for the Petitioner to state and report the facts of the case respectfully submits to the Court the following</p>

<p class="tei_p">That from the affidavit of William Patterson and John W. Beedle herewith returned, it appears that the Petitioner has been imported from the state of Maryland to the County of Alexandria in the District of Columbia, and has been kept in the said County at different times more than one year, that it does not appear that the said Petitioners importation comes within any of the Exceptions of the Act of Assembly by which it might be legalized.</p>

<p class="tei_p">It seems therefore to the subscriber that the said Petitioner under the said Importation is entitled to his freedom and ought to be permitted to bring suit for the recovery thereof in forma pauperis against James Green by whom he is detained as a slave</p>
